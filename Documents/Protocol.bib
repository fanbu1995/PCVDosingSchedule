We would like to expand on the versatility of the clone-censor-weight approach by bringing other applications to the readers’ attention (see Table 1 for a non-exhaustive overview). In all cases, cloning overcomes assignment ambiguity at follow-up time zero that can occur both in dynamic treatment strategies (that change according to evolving patient characteristics) or static treatment strategies (that do not). We propose three main categories (and combinations thereof) relating to: grace periods, static time-related strategies and dynamic strategies.},

	abstract = {This fourth edition incorporating the first addendum, of the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality builds on over 50 years of guidance by {WHO} on drinking-water quality, which has formed an authoritative basis for the setting of national regulations and standards for water safety in support of public health. It is the product of significant revisions to clarify and elaborate on ways of implementing its recommendations of contextual hazard identification and risk management, through the establishment of health-based targets, catchment-to-consumer water safety plans and independent surveillance. It reflects the renewed focus on primary prevention. Significant additional guidance on good practice is presented, incorporating changes introduced by the first and second addenda to the third edition. Emerging water management issues are comprehensively addressed for a range of circumstances, from household water treatment and safe storage and the bulk supply of water over long distances to the potential implications of climate change. Additional risk assessments are presented for a number of new chemical and microbial hazards and applied to a suite of pesticides used for public health purposes. Existing reviews on chemicals and waterborne pathogens have been revised to account for new scientific information. The chapter on radiological aspects of drinking-water quality has been comprehensively updated. Even more than the previous edition, this new edition incorporating the first addendum, emphasizes achievable practices and the formulation of sound regulations, applicable to low-income, middle-income and industrialized countries alike, that aim to prevent a potential health crisis caused by the consumption of unsafe drinking-water, against the backdrop of rapid urbanization, water scarcity and climate change.},

	abstract = {It is estimated that there are approximately nine million cases of human campylobacteriosis per year in the {EU}27. The disease burden of campylobacteriosis and its sequelae is 0.35 million disabilityadjusted life years ({DALYs}) per year and total annual costs are 2.4 billion €. Broiler meat may account for 20\% to 30\% of these, while 50\% to 80\% may be attributed to the chicken reservoir as a whole (broilers as well as laying hens). The public health benefits of controlling Campylobacter in primary broiler production are expected to be greater than control later in the chain as the bacteria may also spread from farms to humans by other pathways than broiler meat. Strict implementation of biosecurity in primary production and {GMP}/{HACCP} during slaughter may reduce colonization of broilers with Campylobacter, and contamination of carcasses. The effects cannot be quantified because they depend on many interrelated local factors. In addition, the use of fly screens, restriction of slaughter age, or discontinued thinning may further reduce consumer risks but have not yet been tested widely. After slaughter, a 100\% risk reduction can be reached by irradiation or cooking of broiler meat on an industrial scale. More than 90\% risk reduction can be obtained by freezing carcasses for 2-3 weeks. A 50-90\% risk reduction can be achieved by freezing for 2-3 days, hot water or chemical carcass decontamination. Achieving a target of 25\% or 5\% {BFP} in all other {MS} is estimated to result in 50\% and 90\% reduction of public health risk, respectively. A public health risk reduction {\textgreater} 50\% or {\textgreater} 90\% could be achieved if all batches would comply with microbiological criteria with a critical limit of 1000 or 500 {CFU}/gram of neck and breast skin, respectively, while 15\% and 45\% of all tested batches would not comply with these criteria.},

Undernutrition, for example, affects 20\% of children in the developing world. The cause and consequence of poor nutrition are multifaceted. Undernutrition has been associated with half of all deaths worldwide in children aged \&lt;5 years; in addition, its pernicious long-term effects in early childhood have been associated with cognitive and physical growth deficits across multiple generations and have been thought to suppress immunity to further infections and to reduce the efficacy of childhood vaccines. The Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health ({MAL}-{ED}) Study, led by the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, has been established at sites in 8 countries with historically high incidence of diarrheal disease and undernutrition. Central to the study is the hypothesis that enteropathogen infection contributes to undernutrition by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. It is further postulated that this leads to growth faltering and deficits in cognitive development. The effects of repeated enteric infection and undernutrition on the immune response to childhood vaccines is also being examined in the study. {MAL}-{ED} uses a prospective longitudinal design that offers a unique opportunity to directly address a complex system of exposures and health outcomes in the community—rather than the relatively rarer circumstances that lead to hospitalization—during the critical period of development of the first 2 years of life. Among the factors being evaluated are enteric infections (with or without diarrhea) and other illness indicators, micronutrient levels, diet, socioeconomic status, gut function, and the environment. {MAL}-{ED} aims to describe these factors, their interrelationships, and their overall impact on health outcomes in unprecedented detail, and to make individual, site-specific, and generalized recommendations regarding the nature and timing of possible interventions aimed at improving child health and development in these resource-poor settings.},

	shorttitle = {Effectiveness of a rural sanitation programme on diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and child malnutrition in Odisha, India},
	abstract = {Background
A third of the 2·5 billion people worldwide without access to improved sanitation live in India, as do two-thirds of the 1·1 billion practising open defecation and a quarter of the 1·5 million who die annually from diarrhoeal diseases. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a rural sanitation intervention, within the context of the Government of India's Total Sanitation Campaign, to prevent diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and child malnutrition.
Methods
We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial between May 20, 2010, and Dec 22, 2013, in 100 rural villages in Odisha, India. Households within villages were eligible if they had a child younger than 4 years or a pregnant woman. Villages were randomly assigned (1:1), with a computer-generated sequence, to undergo latrine promotion and construction or to receive no intervention (control). Randomisation was stratified by administrative block to ensure an equal number of intervention and control villages in each block. Masking of participants was not possible because of the nature of the intervention. However, households were not told explicitly that the purpose of enrolment was to study the effect of a trial intervention, and the surveillance team was different from the intervention team. The primary endpoint was 7-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years. We did intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}01214785.
Findings
We randomly assigned 50 villages to the intervention group and 50 villages to the control group. There were 4586 households (24 969 individuals) in intervention villages and 4894 households (25 982 individuals) in control villages. The intervention increased mean village-level latrine coverage from 9\% of households to 63\%, compared with an increase from 8\% to 12\% in control villages. Health surveillance data were obtained from 1437 households with children younger than 5 years in the intervention group (1919 children younger than 5 years), and from 1465 households (1916 children younger than 5 years) in the control group. 7-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years was 8·8\% in the intervention group and 9·1\% in the control group (period prevalence ratio 0·97, 95\% {CI} 0·83–1·12). 162 participants died in the intervention group (11 children younger than 5 years) and 151 died in the control group (13 children younger than 5 years).
Interpretation
Increased latrine coverage is generally believed to be effective for reducing exposure to faecal pathogens and preventing disease; however, our results show that this outcome cannot be assumed. As efforts to improve sanitation are being undertaken worldwide, approaches should not only meet international coverage targets, but should also be implemented in a way that achieves uptake, reduces exposure, and delivers genuine health gains.

	abstract = {A probabilistic, evidence-based, quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed to investigate public health risks associated with Campylobacter spp. contamination in broiler chicken supply systems in the United States, covering a farm-to-fork continuum. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies in processing plants to protect the safety of chicken consumption and associated consumer health. A baseline model was constructed based on most common industrial practices with minimal interventions for model development and validation purposes. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the most important input parameters for the model and identify critical control points along the supply chain. The effectiveness of possible intervention measures applicable during processing, including alternative processing strategies, chemical processing aids and physical methods to reduce risks of Campylobacter contamination in broiler chicken and campylobacteriosis among consumers were compared using scenario analysis. Input parameter distributions for the model were populated by the results of a previous systematic review and meta-analysis study, rather than evidence collected from the literature by convenience, to reduce possible bias in risk estimations. The final risk estimate was expressed as the number of campylobacteriosis cases per 100,000 persons per year and the intervention effectiveness was expressed as the relative change in campylobacteriosis risk if an intervention had been implemented compared with the baseline. The model estimated an occurrence of 274 (95\% {CI}: 0–561) cases per 100,000 persons per year for baseline. Consumers' food safety practices and operations at processing plants are among the most significant factors to be targeted for reduction in consumers’ exposure to Campylobacter through broiler consumption. Scenario analysis results indicate that chemical processing aids (individually or in tandem) can offer significant reduction in risk estimates. The model is expected to provide a framework for risk managers making risk-based decisions on changes in current poultry processing practices or implementation of alternative intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: 
        Important questions exist regarding the comparative effectiveness of alternative childhood vaccine schedules; however, optimal approaches to studying this complex issue are unclear.
        Methods: 
        We applied methods for studying dynamic treatment regimens to estimate the comparative effectiveness of different rotavirus vaccine ({RV}) schedules for preventing acute gastroenteritis-related emergency department ({ED}) visits or hospitalization. We studied the effectiveness of six separate protocols: one- and two-dose monovalent rotavirus vaccine ({RV}1); one-, two-, and three-dose pentavalent rotavirus vaccine ({RV}5); and no {RV} vaccine. We used data on all infants to estimate the counterfactual cumulative risk for each protocol. Infants were censored when vaccine receipt deviated from the protocol. Inverse probability of censoring-weighted estimation addressed potentially informative censoring by protocol deviations. A nonparametric group-based bootstrap procedure provided statistical inference.
        Results: 
        The method yielded similar 2-year effectiveness estimates for the full-series protocols; weighted risk difference estimates comparing unvaccinated children to those adherent to either full-series (two-dose {RV}1, three-dose {RV}5) corresponded to four fewer hospitalizations and 12 fewer {ED} visits over the 2-year period per 1,000 children. We observed dose–response relationships, such that additional doses further reduced risk of acute gastroenteritis. Under a theoretical intervention to fully vaccinate all children, the 2-year risk differences comparing full to observed adherence were 0.04\% (95\% {CI} = 0.03\%, 0.05\%) for hospitalizations and 0.17\% (95\% {CI} = 0.14\%, 0.19\%) for {ED} visits.
        Conclusions: 
        The proposed approach can generate important evidence about the consequences of delaying or skipping vaccine doses, and the impact of interventions to improve vaccine schedule adherence.},

	abstract = {Acquiring real-world evidence is crucial to support health policy, but observational studies are prone to serious biases. An approach was recently proposed to overcome confounding and immortal-time biases within the emulated trial framework. This tutorial provides a step-by-step description of the design and analysis of emulated trials, as well as R and Stata code, to facilitate its use in practice. The steps consist in: (i) specifying the target trial and inclusion criteria; (ii) cloning patients; (iii) defining censoring and survival times; (iv) estimating the weights to account for informative censoring introduced by design; and (v) analysing these data. These steps are illustrated with observational data to assess the benefit of surgery among 70–89-year-old patients diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer. Because of the severe unbalance of the patient characteristics between treatment arms (surgery yes/no), a naïve Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the initial cohort severely overestimated the benefit of surgery on 1-year survival (22\% difference), as did a survival analysis of the cloned dataset when informative censoring was ignored (17\% difference). By contrast, the estimated weights adequately removed the covariate imbalance. The weighted analysis still showed evidence of a benefit, though smaller (11\% difference), of surgery among older lung cancer patients on 1-year survival. Complementing the {CERBOT} tool, this tutorial explains how to proceed to conduct emulated trials using observational data in the presence of immortal-time bias. The strength of this approach is its transparency and its principles that are easily understandable by non-specialists.},

Objectives We aimed to summarize the evidence of {PCV} impact and effectiveness in children under 5 years old in the {LAC} Region. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature on impact or effectiveness of {PCVs} on deaths or hospitalizations due to invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}), pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. We searched Medline, {WoS}, Lilacs, Scopus, Central and gray literature published in any language from 2009 to January 2016. We included studies addressing the outcomes of interest in children in the target age group, and with the following designs: randomized trials, cohort or case-control, interrupted time series with at least three data points before and after the intervention, and before-after studies. Screening of citations, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted in duplicate by independent reviewers, according to the study protocol registered on {PROSPERO}. Descriptive analysis of the effectiveness measurements and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Effectiveness is reported as 1-{OR} or 1-{RR} for case control or cohort/clinical trials, and as percent change of disease incidence rates for before-after studies. Results We identified 1,085 citations, 892 from databases and 193 from other sources. Of these, 22 were further analyzed. Studies were from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Peru and Nicaragua. Effectiveness ranged from 8.8–37.8\% for hospitalizations due to X-ray confirmed pneumonia, 7.4–20.6\% for clinical pneumonia, and 13.3–87.7\% for meningitis hospitalizations, and 56–83.3\% for {IPD} hospitalization, varying by age, outcome definition, type of vaccine and study design. Conclusions Available evidence to date indicates significant impact of both {PCV}-10 and {PCV}-13 in the outcomes studied, with no evidence of the superiority of one vaccine over the other on pneumonia, {IPD} or meningitis hospitalization reduction in children under 5 years old.},

	abstract = {Background:
To aid decision making for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) use in infant national immunization programs, we summarized the indirect effects of {PCV} on clinical outcomes among nontargeted age groups.

Methods:
We systematically reviewed the English literature on infant {PCV} dosing schedules published from 1994 to 2010 (with ad hoc addition of 2011 articles) for outcomes on children {\textgreater}5 years of age and adults including vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage ({VT}-{NP}), vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease ({VT}-{IPD}) and syndromic pneumonia.

Results:
Of 12,980 citations reviewed, we identified 21 {VT}-{IPD}, 6 {VT}-{NP} and 9 pneumonia studies. Of these 36, 21 (58\%) included 3 primary doses plus {PCV} or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ({PPV}23) booster schedule (3+1 or 3+{PPV}23), 5 (14\%) 3+0, 9 (25\%) 2+1 and 1 (3\%) 2+0. Most (95\%) were {PCV}7 studies. Among observational {VT}-{IPD} studies, all schedules (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1) demonstrated reductions in incidence among young adult groups. Among syndromic pneumonia observational studies (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1), only 3+1 schedules showed significant indirect impact. Of 2 {VT}-{NP} controlled trials (3+0 and 3+1) and 3 {VT}-{NP} observational studies (2+1, 3+1 and 3+{PPV}23), 3+1 and 3+{PPV}23 schedules showed significant indirect effect. The 1 study to directly compare between schedules was a {VT}-{NP} study (2+0 vs. 2+1), which found no indirect effect on older siblings and parents of vaccinated children with either schedule.

Conclusions:
Indirect benefit of a 3+1 infant {PCV} dosing schedule has been demonstrated for {VT}-{IPD}, {VT}-{NP} and syndromic pneumonia; 2+1 and 3+0 schedules have demonstrated indirect effect only for {VT}-{IPD}. The choice of optimal infant {PCV} schedule is limited by data paucity on indirect effects, especially a lack of head-to-head studies and studies of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13.},

	abstract = {Background:
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCV}) are being implemented globally using a variety of different schedules. The optimal schedule to maximize protection of vaccinated children against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease ({VT}-{IPD}) is not known.

Methods:
To assess the relative benefit of various {PCV} dosing schedules, we conducted a systematic review of studies published in English from 1994 to 2010 (supplemented post hoc with studies from 2011) on {PCV} effectiveness against {VT}-{IPD} among children targeted to receive vaccine. Data on 2-dose and 3-dose primary series, both with and without a booster (“2+0,” “2+1,” “3+0” and “3+1”), were included. For observational studies using surveillance data or case counts, we calculated percentage reduction in {VT}-{IPD} before and after {PCV} introduction.

Results:
Of 4 randomized controlled trials and 31 observational studies reporting {VT}-{IPD} among young children, none evaluated a 2+0 complete series, 7 (19\%) evaluated 2+1, 4 (11\%) 3+0 and 27 (75\%) 3+1. Most (86\%) studies were from North America or Europe. Only 1 study (observational) directly compared 2 schedules (3+0 vs. 3+1); results supported the use of a booster dose. In clinical trials, vaccine efficacy ranged from 65\% to 71\% with 3+0 and 83\% to 94\% with 3+1. Surveillance data and case counts demonstrate reductions in {VT}-{IPD} of up to 100\% with 2+1 (6 studies) or 3+1 (17 studies) schedules and up to 90\% with 3+0 (2 studies). Reductions were observed as early as 1 year after {PCV} introduction.

Conclusions:
These data support the use of 2+1, 3+0 and 3+1 schedules, although most data of {PCV} impact on {VT}-{IPD} among young children are from high-income countries using 3+1. Differences between schedules for impact on {VT}-{IPD} are difficult to discern based on available data.},

	abstract = {Vaccination against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has been effective in reducing the burden of severe disease and death from {COVID}-19. Third doses of {mRNA}-based vaccines have provided a way to address waning immunity and broaden protection against emerging {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants. However, their comparative effectiveness for a range of {COVID}-19 outcomes across diverse populations is unknown. We emulated a target trial using electronic health records of {US} veterans who received a third dose of either {BNT}162b2 or {mRNA}-1273 vaccines between 20 October 2021 and 8 February 2022, during a period that included Delta- and Omicron-variant waves. Eligible veterans had previously completed an {mRNA} vaccine primary series. We matched recipients of each vaccine in a 1:1 ratio according to recorded risk factors. Each vaccine group included 65,196 persons. The excess number of events over 16 weeks per 10,000 persons for {BNT}162b2 compared with {mRNA}-1273 was 45.4 (95\% {CI}: 19.4, 84.7) for documented infection, 3.7 (2.2, 14.1) for symptomatic {COVID}-19, 10.6 (5.1, 19.7) for {COVID}-19 hospitalization, 2.0 (−3.1, 6.3) for {COVID}-19 intensive care unit admission and 0.2 (−2.2, 4.0) for {COVID}-19 death. After emulating a second target trial of veterans who received a third dose between 1 January and 1 March 2022, during a period restricted to Omicron-variant predominance, the excess number of events over 9 weeks per 10,000 persons for {BNT}162b2 compared with {mRNA}-1273 was 63.2 (95\% {CI}: 15.2, 100.7) for documented infection. The 16-week risks of {COVID}-19 outcomes were low after a third dose of {mRNA}-1273 or {BNT}162b2, although risks were lower with {mRNA}-1273 than with {BNT}162b2, particularly for documented infection.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models are a key tool for investigating the emergent properties of population health settings, such as infectious disease transmission, where the exposure often violates the key “no interference” assumption of traditional causal inference under the potential outcomes framework. Agent-based models and other simulation-based modeling approaches have generally been viewed as a separate knowledge-generating paradigm from the potential outcomes framework, but this can lead to confusion about how to interpret the results of these models in real-world settings. By explicitly incorporating the target trial framework into the development of an agent-based or other simulation model, we can clarify the causal parameters of interest, as well as make explicit the assumptions required for valid causal effect estimation within or between populations. In this paper, we describe the use of the target trial framework for designing agent-based models when the goal is estimation of causal effects in the presence of interference, or spillover.},

	doi = {10.1097/EDE.0000000000001414},
	abstract = {Background: 
          To stop tuberculosis ({TB}), the leading infectious cause of death globally, we need to better understand transmission risk factors. Although many studies have identified associations between individual-level covariates and pathogen genetic relatedness, few have identified characteristics of transmission pairs or explored how closely covariates associated with genetic relatedness mirror those associated with transmission.
          Methods: 
          We simulated a {TB}-like outbreak with pathogen genetic data and estimated odds ratios ({ORs}) to correlate each covariate and genetic relatedness. We used a naive Bayes approach to modify the genetic links and nonlinks to resemble the true links and nonlinks more closely and estimated modified {ORs} with this approach. We compared these two sets of {ORs} with the true {ORs} for transmission. Finally, we applied this method to {TB} data in Hamburg, Germany, and Massachusetts, {USA}, to find pair-level covariates associated with transmission.
          Results: 
          Using simulations, we found that associations between covariates and genetic relatedness had the same relative magnitudes and directions as the true associations with transmission, but biased absolute magnitudes. Modifying the genetic links and nonlinks reduced the bias and increased the confidence interval widths, more accurately capturing error. In Hamburg and Massachusetts, pairs were more likely to be probable transmission links if they lived in closer proximity, had a shorter time between observations, or had shared ethnicity, social risk factors, drug resistance, or genotypes.
          Conclusions: 
          We developed a method to improve the use of genetic relatedness as a proxy for transmission, and aid in understanding {TB} transmission dynamics in low-burden settings.},

	abstract = {Interference occurs when the treatment of one person affects the outcome of another. For example, in infectious diseases, whether one individual is vaccinated may affect whether another individual becomes infected or develops disease. Quantifying such indirect (or spillover) effects of vaccination could have important public health or policy implications. In this article we use recently developed inverse-probability weighted ({IPW}) estimators of treatment effects in the presence of interference to analyze an individually-randomized, placebo-controlled trial of cholera vaccination that targeted 121,982 individuals in Matlab, Bangladesh. Because these {IPW} estimators have not been employed previously, a simulation study was also conducted to assess the empirical behavior of the estimators in settings similar to the cholera vaccine trial. Simulation study results demonstrate the {IPW} estimators can yield unbiased estimates of the direct, indirect, total, and overall effects of vaccination when there is interference provided the untestable no unmeasured confounders assumption holds and the group-level propensity score model is correctly specified. Application of the {IPW} estimators to the cholera vaccine trial indicates the presence of interference. For example, the {IPW} estimates suggest on average 5.29 fewer cases of cholera per 1000 person-years (95\% confidence interval 2.61, 7.96) will occur among unvaccinated individuals within neighborhoods with 60\% vaccine coverage compared to neighborhoods with 32\% coverage. Our analysis also demonstrates how not accounting for interference can render misleading conclusions about the public health utility of vaccination.},

Research in higher income countries was most likely to be funded by biotech/pharmaceutical companies, whereas research in lower- and middle-income countries was most likely to be funded by U.S. government sources. Overall, we found the distribution of funding sources differed significantly by study and author location (χ2 = 23, p {\textless} .001). Published {RCTs} with {HIV} status or viral load endpoints are financed differently based on where studies take place and where the authors are based. As part of future research, understanding why this variation exists is critical for assessing how funding contributes to global imbalances in scientific resources.},

	abstract = {Immortal time is a span of cohort follow-up during which, because of exposure definition, the outcome under study could not occur. Bias from immortal time was first identified in the 1970s in epidemiology in the context of cohort studies of the survival benefit of heart transplantation. It recently resurfaced in pharmacoepidemiology, with several observational studies reporting that various medications can be extremely effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These studies, while using different cohort designs, all involved some form of immortal time and the corresponding bias. In this paper, the author describes various cohort study designs leading to this bias, quantifies its magnitude under different survival distributions, and illustrates it by using data from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The author shows that for time-based, event-based, and exposure-based cohort definitions, the bias in the rate ratio resulting from misclassified or excluded immortal time increases proportionately to the duration of immortal time. The bias is more pronounced with a decreasing hazard function for the outcome event, as illustrated with the Weibull distribution compared with a constant hazard from the exponential distribution. In conclusion, observational studies of drug benefit in which computerized databases are used must be designed and analyzed properly to avoid immortal time bias.},

	abstract = {The potential for guarantee-time bias ({GTB}), also known as immortal time bias, exists whenever an analysis that is timed from enrollment or random assignment, such as disease-free or overall survival, is compared across groups defined by a classifying event occurring sometime during follow-up. The types of events associated with {GTB} are varied and may include the occurrence of objective disease response, onset of toxicity, or seroconversion. However, comparative analyses using these types of events as predictors are different from analyses using baseline characteristics that are specified completely before the occurrence of any outcome event. Recognizing the potential for {GTB} is not always straightforward, and it can be challenging to know when {GTB} is influencing the results of an analysis. This article defines {GTB}, provides examples of {GTB} from several published articles, and discusses three analytic techniques that can be used to remove the bias: conditional landmark analysis, extended Cox model, and inverse probability weighting. The strengths and limitations of each technique are presented. As an example, we explore the effect of bisphosphonate use on disease-free survival ({DFS}) using data from the {BIG} (Breast International Group) 1-98 randomized clinical trial. An analysis using a naive approach showed substantial benefit for patients who received bisphosphonate therapy. In contrast, analyses using the three methods known to remove {GTB} showed no statistical evidence of a reduction in risk of a {DFS} event with bisphosphonate therapy.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the incremental cost effectiveness of two dose human papillomavirus vaccination and of additionally giving a third dose.
Design Cost effectiveness study based on a transmission dynamic model of human papillomavirus vaccination. Two dose schedules for bivalent or quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccines were assumed to provide 10, 20, or 30 years’ vaccine type protection and cross protection or lifelong vaccine type protection without cross protection. Three dose schedules were assumed to give lifelong vaccine type and cross protection.
Setting United Kingdom.
Population Males and females aged 12-74 years.
Interventions No, two, or three doses of human papillomavirus vaccine given routinely to 12 year old girls, with an initial catch-up campaign to 18 years.
Main outcome measure Costs (from the healthcare provider’s perspective), health related utilities, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios.
Results Giving at least two doses of vaccine seems to be highly cost effective across the entire range of scenarios considered at the quadrivalent vaccine list price of £86.50 (€109.23; \$136.00) per dose. If two doses give only 10 years’ protection but adding a third dose extends this to lifetime protection, then the third dose also seems to be cost effective at £86.50 per dose (median incremental cost effectiveness ratio £17 000, interquartile range £11 700-£25 800). If two doses protect for more than 20 years, then the third dose will have to be priced substantially lower (median threshold price £31, interquartile range £28-£35) to be cost effective. Results are similar for a bivalent vaccine priced at £80.50 per dose and when the same scenarios are explored by parameterising a Canadian model ({HPV}-{ADVISE}) with economic data from the United Kingdom.
Conclusions Two dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules are likely to be the most cost effective option provided protection lasts for at least 20 years. As the precise duration of two dose schedules may not be known for decades, cohorts given two doses should be closely monitored.},

	abstract = {Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial disease that primarily affects infants. To optimize the pertussis vaccination schedule in Israel and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies that add or remove booster doses, we developed an age-structured model for pertussis transmission. Our model was calibrated using 16 years of data from laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases in Israel. Costs and quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) projected by the model within 12 years from the implementation of the considered interventions were compared with the current vaccination schedule. We found that by using the same number of vaccines administered today, the targeting of children at the age of six instead of seven would be predicted to be the optimal schedule to decrease both outpatient visits and hospitalizations. We also found that any increase in maternal vaccination coverage is likely to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$77,000-\$97,000 per {QALY}. By contrast, the contribution of the second booster dose is limited, with a probability of only 0.6 to be cost-effective at \$110,000/{QALY} saved. Additional effort should be invested to encourage maternal vaccination against pertussis. We recommend moving the first booster to age six and prudently considering the necessity of the second booster dose.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccination in addition to the current cervical cancer screening programme in Germany using a dynamic transmission model.
{METHODS}: Based on a mathematical model simulating the transmission dynamics and the natural history of {HPV} infection and associated diseases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer, and genital warts), we estimated the epidemiological and economic consequences of {HPV} vaccination with both the quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines. In our base case analysis, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 12-year-old girls with a 3-dose schedule. In sensitivity analysis, we also evaluated the use of a 2-dose schedule and assessed the impact of vaccinating boys.
{RESULTS}: From a health care payer perspective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({ICERs}) of a 3-dose schedule were €34,249 per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}) for the bivalent and €14,711 per {QALY} for the quadrivalent vaccine. Inclusion of indirect costs decreased {ICERs} by up to 40\%. When adopting a health care payer perspective, {ICERs} of a 2-dose approach decreased to €19,450 per {QALY} for the bivalent and to €3645 per {QALY} for the quadrivalent vaccine. From a societal perspective, a 2-dose approach using the quadrivalent vaccine was a cost-saving strategy while using the bivalent vaccine resulted in an {ICER} of €13,248 per {QALY}. Irrespective of the perspective adopted, additional vaccination of boys resulted in {ICERs} exceeding €50,000 per {QALY}, except for scenarios with low coverage (20\%) in girls.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our model results suggest that routine {HPV} vaccination of 12-year-old girls with three doses is likely to be cost-effective in Germany. Due to the additional impact on genital warts, the quadrivalent vaccine appeared to be more cost-effective than the bivalent vaccine. A 2-dose schedule of the quadrivalent vaccine might even lead to cost savings when adopting a societal perspective. The cost-effectiveness of additional vaccination of boys was highly dependent on the coverage in girls.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: In 2006, the first human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the {USA} based on pre-licensure clinical trials that found it to be highly efficacious at preventing persistent infection and precancerous, high-grade cervical lesions ({HGCLs}) caused by viral types the vaccine protects against. However, the real-world effectiveness of {HPV} vaccines as used in clinical practice may be quite different from the efficacy found in pre-licensure clinical trials. More than 10 years have passed since the introduction of the vaccine programme. It is critical to determine if the full benefits of {HPV} are being realised in real-world settings.
{METHODS} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: The objectives of this study were to estimate the effectiveness of {HPV} vaccines as used in real-world clinical settings and to determine the degree to which the vaccine's effectiveness varies based on age at the time of immunisation and the number of doses received. The study will be a population-based, matched case-control study. Cases will be women with newly diagnosed {HGCL} associated with {HPV} types 16 and 18. Matched controls will be women with a normal Pap test result, matched individually to cases in a 2:1 ratio by age, a practice and date of testing. Medical records will be reviewed to determine dates of receipt of the {HPV} vaccine for all participants. We will use multivariate conditional logistic regression to control for potential confounders.
{ETHICS} {AND} {DISSEMINATION}: This protocol presents minimal risk to the subjects. This protocol has received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Yale University ({HIC}: 1502015308), and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ({HIPAA}) Waiver of Authorisation has been granted to allow investigators to recruit subjects for the study.

Design: Construction and analysis of comprehensive database of randomised controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa based on Medline, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and several African databases.
Setting: Sub-Saharan Africa.
Main outcome measures: Number of trials and randomised subjects for each category of disease in the global burden of disease taxonomy; ratios of disability adjusted life years ({DALYs}) per amount of randomised evidence.
Results: 1179 eligible randomised controlled trials were identified. The number of trials published each year increased over time. Almost half of the trials (n=565) had been done in South Africa. There was relatively good correlation between the estimated burden of disease at year 2000 and the number of trials performed (r=0.53, P=0.024) and the number of participants randomised (r=0.68, P=0.002). However,some conditions—for example, injuries (over 20 000 {DALYs} per patient ever randomised)—were more neglected than others.
Conclusion: Despite recent improvements, few clinical trials are done in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical research in this part of the world should focus more evenly on the major contributors to burden of disease.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study aimed to assess whether randomized controlled trials conducted in Africa with collaborators from outside Africa were more closely associated with health conditions that have a burden of disease that is of specific importance to Africa than with conditions of more general global importance or with conditions important to developed countries. We also assessed whether the source of funding influenced a study's relevance to Africa.
{METHODS}: We compared randomized controlled trials performed in Africa that looked at diseases specifically relevant to Africa (as determined by burden of disease criteria) with trials classified as looking at diseases of global importance or diseases important to developed countries in order to assess differences in collaboration and funding.
{FINDINGS}: Of 520 trials assessed, 347 studied diseases that are specifically important to Africa; 99 studied globally important diseases and 74 studied diseases that are important to developed countries. The strongest independent predictor of whether a study was of specifically African or global importance was the corresponding author's country of origin: African importance was negatively associated with a corresponding author being from South Africa (odds ratio ({OR}) = 0.04; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 0.02-0.10) but there was little difference between corresponding authors from other African countries and corresponding authors from countries outside Africa. The importance of a study to Africa was independently associated with having more non-African authors ({OR} per author = 1.31; 95\% {CI} = 1.08-1.58), fewer trial sites ({OR} per site = 0.69; 95\% {CI} = 0.50-0.96), and reporting of funding ({OR} = 2.14; 95\% {CI} = 1.15-4.00). Similar patterns were present in the comparisons of trials studying diseases important to Africa versus those studying diseases important to developed countries with stronger associations overall. When funding was reported, private industry funding was negatively associated with African importance compared with global importance ({OR} = 0.31, P= 0.008 for African importance and {OR} = 0.51, P= 0.57 for importance for developed countries).
{CONCLUSION}: The relevance to Africa of trials conducted in Africa was not adversely affected by collaboration with non-African researchers but funding from private industry was associated with a decreased emphasis on diseases relevant to Africa.},

	abstract = {Background
Although observational data show social characteristics such as gender or socio-economic status to be strong predictors of health, their impact is seldom investigated in randomised controlled studies ({RCTs}).

Objective \& design
Using a random sample of recent {RCTs} from high-impact journals, we examined how the most often recorded social characteristic, sex/gender, is considered in design, analysis, and interpretation. Of 712 {RCTs} published from September 2008 to 31 December 2013 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Lancet, Canadian Medical Association Journal, or New England Journal of Medicine, we randomly selected 57 to analyse funding, methods, number of centres, documentation of social circumstances, inclusion/exclusion criteria, proportions of women/men, and reporting about sex/gender in analyses and discussion.

Results
Participants’ sex was recorded in most studies (52/57). Thirty-nine percent included men and women approximately equally. Overrepresentation of men in 43\% of studies without explicit exclusions for women suggested interference in selection processes. The minority of studies that did analyse sex/gender differences (22\%) did not discuss or reflect upon these, or dismissed significant findings. Two studies reinforced traditional beliefs about women's roles, finding no impact of breastfeeding on infant health but nevertheless reporting possible benefits. Questionable methods such as changing protocols mid-study, having undefined exclusion criteria, allowing local researchers to remove participants from studies, and suggesting possible benefit where none was found were evident, particularly in industry-funded research.

Conclusions
Social characteristics like sex/gender remain hidden from analyses and interpretation in {RCTs}, with loss of information and embedding of error all along the path from design to interpretation, and therefore, to uptake in clinical practice. Our results suggest that to broaden external validity, in particular, more refined trial designs and analyses that account for sex/gender and other social characteristics are needed.},

	abstract = {When a new vaccine is introduced, it is critical to monitor trends in disease rates to ensure that the vaccine is effective and to quantify its impact. However, estimates from observational studies can be confounded by unrelated changes in healthcare utilization, changes in the underlying health of the population, or changes in reporting. Other diseases are often used to detect and adjust for these changes, but choosing an appropriate control disease a priori is a major challenge. The “synthetic controls” (causal impact) method, which was originally developed for website analytics and social sciences, provides an appealing solution. With this approach, potential comparison time series are combined into a composite and are used to generate a counterfactual estimate, which can be compared with the time series of interest after the intervention. We sought to estimate changes in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia associated with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCVs}) in five countries in the Americas. Using synthetic controls, we found a substantial decline in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia in infants in all five countries (average of 20\%), whereas estimates for young and middle-aged adults varied by country and were potentially influenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect a decline in all-cause pneumonia in older adults in any country. Synthetic controls promise to increase the accuracy of studies of vaccine impact and to increase comparability of results between populations compared with alternative approaches.},

	abstract = {Since second generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCVs}) targeting 10 and 13 serotypes became available in 2010, the number of national policy makers considering these vaccines has steadily increased. An important consideration for a national immunization program is the timing and number of doses—the schedule—that will best prevent disease in the population. Data on disease epidemiology and the efficacy or effectiveness of {PCV} schedules are typically considered when choosing a schedule. Practical concerns, such as the existing vaccine schedule, and vaccine program performance are also important. In low-income countries, pneumococcal disease and deaths typically peak well before the end of the first year of life, making a schedule that provides {PCV} doses early in life (eg, a 6-, 10- and 14-week schedule) potentially the best option. In other settings, a schedule including a booster dose may address disease that peaks in the second year of life or may be seen to enhance a schedule already in place. A large and growing body of evidence from immunogenicity studies, as well as clinical trials and observational studies of carriage, pneumonia and invasive disease, has been systematically reviewed; these data indicate that schedules of 3 or 4 doses all work well, and that the differences between these regimens are subtle, especially in a mature program in which coverage is high and indirect (herd) effects help enhance protection provided directly by a vaccine schedule. The recent World Health Organization policy statement on {PCVs} endorsed a schedule of 3 primary doses without a booster or, as a new alternative, 2 primary doses with a booster dose. While 1 schedule may be preferred in a particular setting based on local epidemiology or practical considerations, achieving high coverage with 3 doses is likely more important than the specific timing of doses.},

Our objective was to identify factors associated with starting but not completing multidose vaccine series.Using 2019 National Immunization Survey-Child data, {US} children ages 19 to 35 months were classified in 1 of 3 vaccination patterns: (1) completed the combined 7-vaccine series, (2) did not initiate ≥1 of the 7 vaccine series, or (3) initiated all series, but did not complete ≥1 multidose series. Associations between sociodemographic factors and vaccination pattern were evaluated using multivariable log-linked binomial regression. Analyses accounted for the survey’s stratified design and complex weighting.Among 16 365 children, 72.9\% completed the combined 7-vaccine series, 9.9\% did not initiate ≥1 series, and 17.2\% initiated, but did not complete ≥1 multidose series. Approximately 8.4\% of children needed only 1 additional vaccine dose from 1 of the 5 multidose series to complete the combined 7-vaccine series. The strongest associations with starting but not completing multidose vaccine series were moving across state lines (adjusted prevalence ratio [{aPR}] = 1.45, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.18–1.79), number of children in the household (2 to 3: {aPR} = 1.29, 95\% {CI}: 1.05–1.58; 4 or more: {aPR} = 1.68, 95\% {CI}: 1.30–2.18), and lack of insurance coverage ({aPR} = 2.03, 95\% {CI}: 1.42–2.91).More than 1 in 6 {US} children initiated but did not complete all doses in multidose vaccine series, suggesting children experienced structural barriers to vaccination.

	abstract = {Introduction
Reliable information on rates of up-to-date coverage and timely administration of routine childhood immunisations are critical for guiding public health efforts worldwide, yet prospective observation of vaccination programmes within individual communities is rare. Here, we provide a longitudinal analysis of the directly observed administration of a three-dose primary vaccination series to infants in a low-resource community in Lusaka, Zambia.

Methods
Throughout 2015, we recruited a longitudinal birth cohort of mother/infant pairs (initial enrolment, 1981 pairs; attending, 1497 pairs) from the periurban informal settlement of Chawama compound, located in Lusaka, Zambia. We prospectively monitored the administration of scheduled diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis ({DTP}) vaccinations across the first 14–18 weeks of life. We analysed study attendance and vaccine coverage, both overall and stratified by age group. We employed Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate delays in age-appropriate administration of vaccine doses. We also assessed schedule timing violations, including early and compressed dose administration.

Results
At study completion, first dose ({DTP}1) rates were high (92.9\% of attending), whereas third dose completion ({DTP}3) rates were far lower (61.9\%). Missed vaccinations and study dropout both contributed to the low {DTP}3 completion rates. {DTP}1 was administered very late (at or after 10 weeks) to 61 infants (4.1\%). {DTP}1 was administered too early to 64 infants (4.3\%), and 77 (5.1\%) received consecutive doses below the minimum recommended spacing of 28 days.

Conclusions
We observe substantial individual variation in the timing of early childhood {DTP} doses, though following this birth cohort proved challenging. Our results indicate that timely administration of both {DTP}1 and {DTP}3 remains a challenge in this community. These directly-observed, individual-based results provide an important counterpoint to more course-grained, survey-based national and province estimates of up-to-date vaccine coverage. This study also highlights the challenges of vaccine hesitancy and suboptimal utilisation of (no-cost) healthcare services in a low-resource urban setting.},

The {COVID}-19 pandemic, since 2020, has affected health care services and access globally. Although the entire impact of {COVID}-19 pandemic on existing global public health is yet to be fully seen, the impact of {COVID}-19 pandemic on global childhood immunization programs is of particular importance.

Recent Findings
Disruptions to service delivery due to lockdowns, challenges in vaccination programs, vaccine misinformation and hesitancy, and political and social economic inequalities all posed a threat to existing childhood immunization programs. These potential threats were especially critical in {LMIC} where childhood immunization programs tend to experience suboptimal implementation.

Summary
This review provides an overview of childhood immunizations and discusses past pandemics particularly in {LMIC}, factors contributing to disparities in childhood immunizations, and reviews potential lessons to be learned from past pandemics. Vaccine hesitancy, social determinants of health, and best practices to help lessen the pandemic’s influence are also further elaborated. To address current challenges that hindered the progress made in prevention of childhood illnesses through vaccination campaigns and increased vaccine availability, lessons learned through best practices explored from past pandemics must be examined to mitigate impact of {COVID}-19 on childhood immunization and in turn conserve health and improve economic well-being of children especially in {LMIC}.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has affected routine vaccine delivery in the {US} and globally. The magnitude of these disruptions and their association with childhood vaccination coverage are unclear.To compare trends in pediatric vaccination before and during the pandemic and to evaluate the proportion of children up to date ({UTD}) with vaccinations by age, race, and ethnicity.This surveillance study used a prepandemic-postpandemic control design with data from 8 health systems in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Children from age groups younger than 24 months and 4 to 6, 11 to 13, and 16 to 18 years were included if they had at least 1 week of health system enrollment from January 5, 2020, through October 3, 2020, over periods before the {US} {COVID}-19 pandemic (January 5, 2020, through March 14, 2020), during age-limited preventive care (March 15, 2020, through May 16, 2020), and during expanded primary care (May 17, 2020, through October 3, 2020). These individuals were compared with those enrolled during analogous weeks in 2019.This study evaluated {UTD} status among children reaching specific ages in February, May, and September 2020, compared with those reaching these ages in 2019.Weekly vaccination rates for routine age-specific vaccines and the proportion of children {UTD} for all age-specific recommended vaccines.Of 1 399 708 children in 2019 and 1 402 227 in 2020, 1 371 718 were female (49.0\%) and 1 429 979 were male (51.0\%); 334 216 Asian individuals (11.9\%), 900 226 were Hispanic individuals (32.1\%), and 201 619 non-Hispanic Black individuals (7.2\%). Compared with the prepandemic period and 2019, the age-limited preventive care period was associated with lower weekly vaccination rates, with ratios of rate ratios of 0.82 (95\% {CI}, 0.80-0.85) among those younger than 24 months, 0.18 (95\% {CI}, 0.16-0.20) among those aged 4 to 6 years, 0.16 (95\% {CI}, 0.14-0.17) among those aged 11 to 13 years, and 0.10 (95\% {CI}, 0.08-0.13) among those aged 16 to 18 years. Vaccination rates during expanded primary care remained lower for most ages (ratios of rate ratios: \&lt;24 months, 0.96 [95\% {CI}, 0.93-0.98]; 11-13 years, 0.81 [95\% {CI}, 0.76-0.86]; 16-18 years, 0.57 [95\% {CI}, 0.51-0.63]). In September 2020, 74\% (95\% {CI}, 73\%-76\%) of infants aged 7 months and 57\% (95\% {CI}, 56\%-58\%) of infants aged 18 months were {UTD} vs 81\% (95\% {CI}, 80\%-82\%) and 61\% (95\% {CI}, 60\%-62\%), respectively, in September 2019. The proportion {UTD} was lowest in non-Hispanic Black children across most age groups, both during and prior to the {COVID}-19 pandemic (eg, in May 2019, 70\% [95\% {CI}, 64\%-75\%] of non-Hispanic Black infants aged 7 months were {UTD} vs 82\% [95\% {CI}, 81\%-83\%] in all infants aged 7 months combined).As of September 2020, childhood vaccination rates and the proportion who were {UTD} remained lower than 2019 levels. Interventions are needed to promote catch-up vaccination, particularly in populations at risk for underimmunization.},

The United States declared a national emergency and, on March 18, 2020, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidance advising pediatricians to restrict preventive care visits to younger children requiring immunizations. Pediatric primary care visit volumes precipitously declined. A growing literature is helping to define this impact and raise questions about how best to address the consequences of that lost care.In this issue of {JAMA} Pediatrics, {DeSilva} et al address the critical issue for the pediatric community of declining vaccination rates during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The study team used data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative effort between the {US} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Immunization Safety Office and 8 integrated health care organizations across 6 {US} states. Using this data set, the study team conducted a retrospective observational study with a pre-post control design, examining both weekly routine childhood vaccination rates and the proportion of children in key age groups with up-to-date ({UTD}) vaccinations as of February, May, and September 2020. The study team then compared these rates with comparable 2019 time periods. Analyzing the data for approximately 1.4 million children in each year, the study team identified substantially lower rates of weekly vaccine administration across age groups during the early months of the {COVID}-19 pandemic, followed by an increase to near prepandemic levels from summer into fall 2020. Despite the return to more typical levels of vaccination, the proportion of children with {UTD} vaccinations was lower among the 7-month, 18-month, and 13-year age groups while remaining stable for the 6- and 18-year age groups.},

The current document replaces the position paper on the use 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine published in 2007 [2]. Incorporating the most recent developments in the field of pneumococcal vaccines this position paper focuses on the currently available 10-valent and 13-valent conjugate vaccines and their introduction and use in national immunization programmes. It also deals with the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine, though in less detail than provided in the April 2008 position paper which remains valid [3]. Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references including references to grading tables that assess the quality of scientific evidence for a few key conclusions. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, {WHO} issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with {WHO}'s current position on the use of vaccines worldwide. This paper reflects the recommendations of the {WHO}'s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ({SAGE}) on immunization. Recommendations on the use of pneumococcal vaccines were discussed by {SAGE} at its meetings in November 2006 (conjugate vaccine) and April 2008 (polysaccharide vaccine) and most recently in November 2011.

	shorttitle = {Efficacy against pneumococcal carriage and the immunogenicity of reduced-dose (0 + 1 and 1 + 1) {PCV}10 and {PCV}13 schedules in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam},
	abstract = {Background
Interest in reduced-dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) schedules is growing, but data on their ability to provide direct and indirect protection are scarce. We evaluated 1 + 1 (at 2 months and 12 months) and 0 + 1 (at 12 months) schedules of {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 in a predominately unvaccinated population.
Methods
In this parallel, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, healthy infants aged 2 months were recruited from birth records in three districts in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and assigned (4:4:4:4:9) to one of five groups: {PCV}10 at 12 months of age (0 + 1 {PCV}10), {PCV}13 at 12 months of age (0 + 1 {PCV}13), {PCV}10 at 2 months and 12 months of age (1 + 1 {PCV}10), {PCV}13 at 2 months and 12 months of age (1 + 1 {PCV}13), and unvaccinated control. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation, and the infants' caregivers and those administering vaccines were not. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months were analysed for pneumococcal carriage. Blood samples collected from a subset of participants (200 per group) at various timepoints were analysed by {ELISA} and opsonophagocytic assay. The primary outcome was the efficacy of each schedule against vaccine-type carriage at 24 months, analysed by intention to treat for all those with a nasopharyngeal swab available. This trial is registered at {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}03098628.
Findings
2501 infants were enrolled between March 8, 2017, and July 24, 2018 and randomly assigned to study groups (400 to 0 + 1 {PCV}10, 400 to 0 + 1 {PCV}13, 402 to 1 + 1 {PCV}10, 401 to 1 + 1 {PCV}13, and 898 to control). Analysis of the primary endpoint included 341 participants for 0 + 1 {PCV}10, 356 0 + 1 {PCV}13, 358 1 + 1 {PCV}10, 350 1 + 1 {PCV}13, and 758 control. At 24 months, a 1 + 1 {PCV}10 schedule reduced {PCV}10-type carriage by 58\% (95\% {CI} 25 to 77), a 1 + 1 {PCV}13 schedule reduced {PCV}13-type carriage by 65\% (42 to 79), a 0 + 1 {PCV}10 schedule reduced {PCV}10-type carriage by 53\% (17 to 73), and a 0 + 1 {PCV}13 schedule non-significantly reduced {PCV}13-type carriage by 25\% (–7 to 48) compared with the unvaccinated control group. Reactogenicity and serious adverse events were similar across groups.
Interpretation
A 1 + 1 {PCV} schedule greatly reduces vaccine-type carriage and is likely to generate substantial herd protection and provide some degree of individual protection during the first year of life. Such a schedule is suitable for mature {PCV} programmes or for introduction in conjunction with a comprehensive catch-up campaign, and potentially could be most effective given as a mixed regimen ({PCV}10 then {PCV}13). A 0 + 1 {PCV} schedule has some effect on carriage along with a reasonable immune response and could be considered for use in humanitarian crises or remote settings.

	abstract = {Background
Infants in the {UK} were first offered a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}7) in 2006, given at 2 and 4 months of age and a booster dose at 13 months (2 + 1 schedule). A 13-valent vaccine ({PCV}13) replaced {PCV}7 in 2010. We aimed to compare the post-booster antibody response in {UK} infants given a reduced priming schedule of {PCV}13 (ie, a 1 + 1 schedule) versus the current 2 + 1 schedule and to assess the potential effect on population protection.
Methods
In this multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, we recuited infants due to receive their primary immunisations aged up to 13 weeks on first vaccinations by information booklets mailed out via the {NHS} Child Health Information Service and the {UK} National Health Application and Infrastructure Services. Eligible infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive {PCV}13 at 2, 4, and 12 months (2 + 1 schedule) or 3 and 12 months of age (1 + 1 schedule) delivered with other routine vaccinations. Randomisation was done by computer-generated permuted block randomisation, with a block size of six. Participants and clinical trial staff were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was serotype-specific immunoglobulin G concentrations values (geometric mean concentrations [{GMC}] in μg/{mL}) measured in blood samples collected at 13 months of age. Analysis was by modified intention to treat with all individuals included by randomised group if they had a laboratory result. This trial is registered on the {EudraCT} clinical trial database, number 2015-000817-32, and {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}02482636.
Findings
Between September, 2015, and June, 2016, 376 infants were assessed for eligibility. 81 infants were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria (n=50) or for other reasons (n=31). 213 eligible infants were enrolled and randomly allocated to group 1 (n=106; 2 + 1 schedule) or to group 2 (n=107; 1 + 1 schedule). In group 1, 91 serum samples were available for analysis 1 month after booster immunisation versus 86 in group 2. At month 13, post-booster, {GMCs} were equivalent between schedules for serotypes 3 (0·61 μg/{mL} in group 1 vs 0·62 μg/{mL} in group 2), 5 (1·74 μg/{mL} vs 2·11 μg/{mL}), 7F (3·98 μg/{mL} vs 3·36 μg/{mL}), 9V (2·34 μg/{mL} vs 2·50 μg/{mL}), and 19A (8·38 μg/{mL} vs 8·83 μg/{mL}). Infants given the 1 + 1 schedule had significantly greater immunogenicity post-booster than those given the 2 + 1 schedule for serotypes 1 (8·92 μg/{mL} vs 3·07 μg/{mL}), 4 (3·43 μg/{mL} vs 2·55 μg/{mL}), 14 (16·9 μg/{mL} vs 10·49 μg/{mL}), and 19F (14·76 μg/{mL} vs 11·12 μg/{mL}; adjusted p value range {\textless}0·001 to 0·047). The 2 + 1 schedule was superior for serotypes 6A, 6B, 18C and 23F (adjusted p value range {\textless}0·0001 to 0·017). In a predefined numerical subset of all of the infants recruited to the study (n=40 [20\%]), functional serotype-specific antibody was similar between schedules. 26 serious adverse events were recorded in 21 (10\%) infants across the study period; 18 (n=13) were in the 2 + 1 group and eight (n=8) in the 1 + 1 group. Only one serious adverse event, a high temperature and refusal to feed after the first vaccination visit in a child on the 2+1 schedule was considered related to vaccine.
Interpretation
Our findings show that for nine of the 13 serotypes in {PCV}13, post-booster responses in infants primed with a single dose are equivalent or superior to those seen following the standard {UK} 2 + 1 schedule. Introducing a 1 + 1 schedule in countries with a mature {PCV} programme and established herd immunity is likely to maintain population control of vaccine-type pneumococcal disease.

Routine childhood immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) has changed the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease across age groups, providing an opportunity to reconsider {PCV} dosing schedules.

We did an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised study in {HIV}-unexposed infants at a single centre in Soweto, South Africa. Infants were randomly assigned to receive one priming dose of {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 at ages 6 weeks (6w + 1 {PCV}10 and 6w + 1 {PCV}13 groups) or 14 weeks (14w + 1 {PCV}10 and 14w + 1 {PCV}13 groups) or two priming doses of {PCV}10 or {PCV}13, one each at ages 6 weeks and 14 weeks (2 + 1 {PCV}10 and 2 + 1 {PCV}13 groups); all participants then received a booster dose of {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 at 40 weeks of age. The primary endpoint was geometric mean concentrations ({GMCs}) of serotype-specific {IgG} 1 month after the booster dose, which was assessed in all participants who received {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 as per the assigned randomisation group and for whom laboratory results were available at that timepoint. The 1 + 1 vaccine schedule was considered non-inferior to the 2 + 1 vaccine schedule if the lower bound of the 96\% {CI} for the {GMC} ratio was greater than 0·5 for at least ten {PCV}13 serotypes and eight {PCV}10 serotypes. Safety was a secondary endpoint. This trial is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov ({NCT}02943902) and is ongoing.
Findings
Of 1695 children assessed, 600 were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the six groups between Jan 9 and Sept 20, 2017; 542 were included in the final analysis of the primary endpoint (86–93 per group). For both {PCV}13 and {PCV}10, a 1+1 dosing schedule (either beginning at 6 or 14 weeks) was non-inferior to a 2 + 1 schedule. For {PCV}13, the lower limit of the 96\% {CI} for the ratio of {GMCs} between the 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 groups was higher than 0·5 for ten serotypes in the 6w+1 group (excluding 6B, 14, and 23F) and 11 serotypes in the 14w + 1 group (excluding 6B and 23F). For {PCV}10, the lower limit of the 96\% {CI} for the ratio of {GMCs} was higher than 0·5 for all ten serotypes in the 6w+1 and 14w + 1 groups. 84 serious adverse events were reported in 72 (12\%) of 600 participants. 15 occurred within 28 days of vaccination, but none were considered to be related to {PCV} injection. There were no cases of culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease.
Interpretation
The non-inferiority in post-booster immune responses following a single-dose compared with a two-dose primary series of {PCV}13 or {PCV}10 indicates the potential for reducing {PCV} dosing schedules from a 2 + 1 to 1 + 1 series in low-income and middle-income settings with well established {PCV} immunisation programmes.

	abstract = {Background
Data are scarce from low-income and middle-income countries ({LMICs}) to support the choice of vaccination schedule for the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ({PCV}). We aimed to compare the immunogenicity of four different infant {PCV}10 schedules in infants in Vietnam.
Methods
In this single-blind, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, infants aged 2 months were recruited by community health staff in districts 4 and 7 of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Eligible infants had no clinically significant maternal or prenatal history and were born at or after 36 weeks' gestation. Participants were randomly assigned (3:3:5:4:5:4) using block randomisation, stratified by district, to one of six {PCV}10 or {PCV}13 vaccination schedules. Here we report results for four groups: group A, who were given {PCV}10 at ages 2, 3, 4, and 9 months (a 3 + 1 schedule); group B, who were vaccinated at ages 2, 3, and 4 months (3 + 0 schedule); group C, who were vaccinated at ages 2, 4, and 9·5 months (2 + 1 schedule); and group D, who were vaccinated at ages 2 and 6 months (two-dose schedule). Laboratory-based assessors were masked to group allocation. Blood samples were collected at different prespecified timepoints between ages 3–18 months depending on group allocation, within 27–43 days after vaccination, and these were analysed for serotype-specific {IgG} and opsonophagocytic responses. Participants were followed-up until age 24 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with serotype-specific {IgG} levels of 0·35 μg/{mL} or higher at age 5 months, analysed as a non-inferiority comparison (10\% margin) of the two-dose and three-dose primary series (group C vs groups A and B combined). We also compared responses 4 weeks after two doses administered at either ages 2 and 4 months (group C) or at ages 2 and 6 months (group D). The primary endpoint was analysed in the per-protocol population. Reactogenicity has been reported previously. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}01953510, and is now closed to accrual.
Findings
Between Sept 30, 2013, and Jan 9, 2015, 1201 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to group A (n=152), group B (n=149), group C (n=250), group D (n=202), or groups E (n=251) and F (n=197). In groups A–D, 388 (52\%) of 753 participants were female and 365 (48\%) were male. 286 (95\%) participants in groups A and B combined (three-dose primary series) and 237 (95\%) in group C (two-dose primary series) completed the primary vaccination series and had blood samples taken within the specified time window at age 5 months (per-protocol population). At this timepoint, a two-dose primary series was non-inferior to a three-dose primary series for eight of ten vaccine serotypes; exceptions were 6B (84·6\% [95\% {CI} 79·9–88·6] of infants had protective {IgG} concentrations after three doses [groups A and B combined] vs 76·8\% [70·9–82·0] of infants after two doses [group C]; risk difference 7·8\% [90\% {CI} 2·1–13·6]) and 23F (90·6\% [95\% {CI} 86·6–93·7] vs 77·6\% [71·8–82·2]; 12·9\% [90\% {CI} 7·7–18·3]). Two doses at ages 2 and 6 months produced higher antibody levels than two doses at ages 2 and 4 months for all serotypes except 5 and 7F.
Interpretation
A two-dose primary vaccination series was non-inferior to a three-dose primary vaccination series while two doses given with a wider interval between doses increased immunogenicity. The use of a two-dose primary vaccination schedule using a wider interval could be considered in {LMIC} settings to extend protection in the second year of life.

	abstract = {Background
This study investigated the immunogenicity and impact on nasopharyngeal carriage of a single dose of {PCV}10 given to 18-month-old Vietnamese children. This information is important for countries considering catch-up vaccination during {PCV} introduction and in the context of vaccination during humanitarian crises.
Methods
Two groups of {PCV}-naïve children within the Vietnam Pneumococcal Project received {PCV}10 (n=197) or no {PCV} (unvaccinated; n=199) at 18 months of age. Blood samples were collected at 18, 19, and 24 months of age, and nasopharyngeal swabs at 18 and 24 months of age. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring serotype-specific {IgG}, opsonophagocytosis ({OPA}) and memory B cells (Bmem). Pneumococci were detected and quantified using real-time {PCR} and serotyped by microarray.
Findings
At 19 months of age, {IgG} and {OPA} responses were higher in the {PCV}10 group compared with the unvaccinated group for all {PCV}10 serotypes and cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A. This was sustained out to 24 months of age, at which point {PCV}10-type carriage was 60\% lower in the {PCV}10 group than the unvaccinated group. Bmem levels increased between 18 and 24 months of age in the vaccinated group.
Interpretation
We demonstrate strong protective immune responses in vaccinees following a single dose of {PCV}10 at 18 months of age, and a potential impact on herd protection through a substantial reduction in vaccine-type carriage. A single dose of {PCV}10 in the second year of life could be considered as part of catch-up campaigns or in humanitarian crises to protect children at high-risk of pneumococcal disease.},

Methods 600 Kenyan children aged 12–59 months were vaccinated at days 0, 60 and 180 in a double-blind randomized controlled trial according to the following vaccine sequence: Group A: {PHiD}-{CV}, {PHiD}-{CV}, diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis vaccine ({DTaP}); Group B: {PHiD}-{CV}, {DTaP}, {PHiD}-{CV}; Group C: hepatitis A vaccine ({HAV}), {DTaP}, {HAV}. Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae was measured at five timepoints. In 375 subjects, serotype-specific responses were measured by 22F-inhibition {ELISA} and opsonophagocytic killing assays ({OPA}) one month after vaccination. Results Following one dose of {PHiD}-{CV}, {\textgreater}90\% of recipients developed {IgG}≥0.35 µg/{mL} to serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V and 18C and {OPA}≥8 to serotypes 4, 7F, 9V, 18C, 23F. After a second dose {\textgreater}90\% of recipients had {IgG}≥0.35 µg/{mL} to all vaccine serotypes and {OPA}≥8 to all vaccine serotypes except 1 and 6B. At day 180, carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci was 21\% in recipients of two doses of {PHiD}-{CV} (Group A) compared to 31\% in controls (p = 0.04). Fever after dose 1 was reported by 41\% of {PHiD}-{CV} recipients compared to 26\% of {HAV} recipients (p{\textless}0.001). Other local and systemic adverse experiences were similar between groups. Conclusions Vaccination of children aged 12–59 months with two doses of {PHiD}-{CV} two to six months apart was immunogenic, reduced vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage and was well-tolerated. Administration of {PHiD}-{CV} would be expected to provide effective protection against vaccine-type disease. Trial Registration {ClinicalTrials}.gov {NCT}01028326},

Whereas {PCV}-derived protection against vaccine-serotype colonization is responsible for herd effects of vaccination, dose-specific {PCV} effectiveness against colonization endpoints is not known. We aimed to assess the performance of differing {PCV} schedules against vaccine-serotype colonization in children.From 2009–2016, we monitored pneumococcal carriage in southern Israel, where children should receive {PCV} at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months (2 primary [p] +1 booster [b] schedule). We analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs and vaccination histories from 5928 children aged 0–59 months without symptoms of diseases potentially attributable to pneumococci. Matching individuals on age, sex, ethnicity, visit timing, and recent antibiotic receipt, we measured schedule-specific 7-valent {PCV} ({PCV}7) and 13-valent {PCV} ({PCV}13) effectiveness against vaccine-serotype colonization in a modified case-control framework. We sampled from the distribution of all possible case-control match assignments for statistical analyses.Receiving 2 primary-series {PCV}13 doses conferred 53\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 32–67\%) protection against {PCV}13-serotype colonization at ages ≤12 months; 1 primary-series dose was not protective. A 2p+1b {PCV}13 series conferred 40\% (95\% {CI}, 4–67\%) and 62\% (95\% {CI}, 33–83\%) protection against {PCV}13-serotype colonization at ages 13–24 months and 25–59 months, respectively. Estimates suggested greater {PCV}13-conferred protection against {PCV}7-targeted serotypes than the 6 {PCV}13-only serotypes. As compared to children receiving 2p+1b {PCV}13 dosing, those receiving 1p+1b and 2p+0b schedules experienced 2.05-fold (95\% {CI}, 1.12–5.00) and 3.33-fold (95\% {CI}, 2.28–4.93) greater odds, respectively, of vaccine-serotype pneumococcal colonization at ages 13–24 months.Our results demonstrate real-world effectiveness of 2p+1b {PCV} dosing against vaccine-serotype colonization. Reduced-dose schedules may confer lower protection against vaccine-serotype carriage during and beyond the first year of life.},

	abstract = {While the large majority of parents in the U.S. vaccinate their children according to the recommended immunization schedule, some parents have refused or delayed vaccinating, often citing safety concerns. In response to public concern, the U.S. Institute of Medicine ({IOM}) evaluated existing research regarding the safety of the recommended immunization schedule. The {IOM} concluded that although available evidence strongly supported the safety of the currently recommended schedule as a whole, additional observational research was warranted to compare health outcomes between fully vaccinated children and those on a delayed or alternative schedule. In addition, the {IOM} identified the Vaccine Safety Datalink ({VSD}) as an important resource for conducting this research. Guided by the {IOM} findings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}) commissioned a White Paper to assess how the {VSD} could be used to study the safety of the childhood immunization schedule. Guided by subject matter expert engagement, the resulting White Paper outlines a 4 stage approach for identifying exposure groups of undervaccinated children, presents a list of health outcomes of highest priority to examine in this context, and describes various study designs and statistical methods that could be used to analyze the safety of the schedule. While it appears feasible to study the safety of the recommended immunization schedule in settings such as the {VSD}, these studies will be inherently complex, and as with all observational studies, will need to carefully address issues of confounding and bias. In light of these considerations, decisions about conducting studies of the safety of the schedule will also need to assess epidemiological evidence of potential adverse events that could be related to the schedule, the biological plausibility of an association between an adverse event and the schedule, and public concern about the safety of the schedule.},

	abstract = {Purpose Health plan disenrollment occurs frequently in commercial insurance claims databases. If individuals who disenroll are different from those who remain enrolled, informative censoring may bias descriptive statistics as well as estimates of causal effect. We explored whether patterns of disenrollment varied by patient or health plan characteristics. Methods In a large cohort of commercially insured adults (2007-2013), we examined two primary outcomes: (a) within-year disenrollment between January 1 and December 30, which was considered to occur due to patient disenrollment from the health plan, and (b) end-of-year disenrollment on December 31, which was considered to occur due to either patient disenrollment from the health plan or withdrawal of the entire health plan from the commercial insurance database. In yearly cohorts, we identified factors independently associated with disenrollment by using log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios ({RR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}). Results Among 2 053 100 unique patient years, the annual proportion of within-year disenrollment remained steady across years (range, 13\% to 14\%) whereas the annual proportion of end-of-year disenrollment varied widely (range, 8\% to 26\%). Independent predictors of within-year disenrollment were related to health status, including age, comorbidities, frailty, hospitalization, emergency room visits, use of durable medical equipment, use of preventive care, and use of prescription medications. In contrast, independent predictors of end-of-year disenrollment were related to health plan characteristics including insurance plan type and geographic characteristics. Conclusions Differential risk of disenrollment suggests that analytic approaches to address selection bias should be considered in studies using commercial insurance databases.},

	abstract = {The term "selection bias" encompasses various biases in epidemiology. We describe examples of selection bias in case-control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring). We argue that the causal structure underlying the bias in each example is essentially the same: conditioning on a common effect of 2 variables, one of which is either exposure or a cause of exposure and the other is either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding"). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

We give results for additive, risk-ratio and odds-ratio scales. We show that these results encompass a number of more specific sensitivity-analysis methods in the statistics and epidemiology literature. The applicability, usefulness, and limits of the bias-adjustment formulas are discussed. We illustrate the sensitivity-analysis techniques that follow from our results by applying them to 3 different studies.

In this study, we used a transmission model to examine the potential of using serological surveillance to inform the timing of {COVID}-19 boosters in Mozambique. We simulated using population-level seroprevalence thresholds as an estimate of the risk of outbreaks to trigger the timing of re-vaccination campaigns among older adults. We compare this approach to a strategy of re-vaccination at fixed time intervals. Vaccinating older adults each time the seroprevalence among older adults falls below 50\% and 80\% resulted in medians of 20\% and 71\% reduction in deaths, respectively, and number-needed-to-vaccinate to avert one death ({NNT}) of 1,499 (2.5th-97.5th centile:1,252-1,905) and 3,151 (2,943-3,429), respectively. In comparison, biennial and annual re-vaccination of older adults resulted in medians of 35\% and 52\% deaths averted, respectively, and {NNTs} of 1,443 (1,223-1,733) and 1,941 (1,805-2,112), respectively. We conducted sensitivity analysis over a range of antibody waning rates and epidemic scenarios and found that re-vaccination trigger thresholds of 50-60\% seroprevalence are most likely to be efficient compared to fixed-time strategies. However, given marginal gains in efficiency even in the best-case scenarios, our results favor the use of simpler fixed-time strategies for long-term control of {SARS}-{CoV}-2.},

Model components (subsets of agents connected through partnerships in a sexual network but not sharing partnerships with any other agents) were first randomized to an intervention coverage level or the control group; then, within intervention components, eligible agents were randomized to receive or not receive {PrEP}. We calculated direct and disseminated (indirect) effects using randomization-based estimators and report corresponding 95\% simulation intervals across scenarios ranging from 10\% coverage in the intervention components to 90\% coverage. A population of 11,245 agents was simulated, with an average of 1,551 components identified. When comparing agents randomized to no {PrEP} in 70\% coverage components with control agents, there was a 15\% disseminated risk reduction in {HIV} incidence (risk ratio = 0.85, 95\% simulation interval: 0.65, 1.05). Persons not on {PrEP} may receive a protective benefit by being in a sexual network with higher {PrEP} coverage.

	abstract = {Background: 
          Observational studies are often the only option to estimate effects of interventions during pregnancy. Causal inference from observational data can be conceptualized as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical pragmatic randomized trial: the target trial.
          Objective: 
          To provide a step-by-step description of how to use healthcare databases to estimate the effects of interventions initiated during pregnancy. As an example, we describe how to specify and emulate a target trial of {COVID}-19 vaccination during pregnancy, but the framework can be generally applied to point and sustained strategies involving both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.
          Methods: 
          First, we specify the protocol of a target trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vaccination during pregnancy. Second, we describe how to use observational data to emulate each component of the protocol of the target trial. We propose different target trials for different gestational periods because the outcomes of interest vary by gestational age at exposure. We identify challenges that affect (i) the target trial and thus its observational emulation (censoring and competing events), and (ii) mostly the observational emulation (confounding, immortal time, and measurement biases).
          Conclusion: 
          Some biases may be unavoidable in observational emulations, but others are avoidable. For instance, immortal time bias can be avoided by aligning the start of follow-up with the gestational age at the time of the intervention, as we would do in the target trial. Explicitly emulating target trials at different gestational ages can help reduce bias and improve the interpretability of effect estimates for interventions during pregnancy.},

	shorttitle = {Impact of {CoronaVac} on Covid-19 outcomes of elderly adults in a large and socially unequal Brazilian city},
	abstract = {Background
Although {CoronaVac} was the only Covid-19 vaccine adopted in the first months of the Brazilian vaccination campaign, randomized clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy in elderly adults were limited. In this study, we use routinely collected surveillance and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccination and testing data comprising the population of the fifth largest city of Brazil to evaluate the effectiveness of {CoronaVac} in adults 60+ years old against severe outcomes.
Methods
Using large observational databases on vaccination and surveillance data from the city of Fortaleza, Brazil, we defined a retrospective cohort including 324,302 eligible adults aged ≥60 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the {CoronaVac} vaccine. The cohort included individuals vaccinated between January 21, 2021, and August 31, 2021, who were matched with unvaccinated persons at the time of rollout following a 1:1 ratio according to baseline covariates of age, sex, and Human Development Index of the neighborhood of residence. Only Covid-19-related severe outcomes were included in the analysis: hospitalization, {ICU} admission, and death. Vaccine effectiveness for each outcome was calculated by using the risk ratio between the two groups, with the risk obtained by the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
Results
We obtained 62,643 matched pairs for assessing the effectiveness of the two-dose regimen of {CoronaVac}. The demographic profile of the matched population was statistically representative of the population of Fortaleza. Using the cumulative incidence as the risk associated with each group, starting at day 14 since the receipt of the second dose, we found an 82.3 \% (95 \% {CI} 66.3–93.9) effectiveness against Covid-19-related death, 68.4 \% (95 \% {CI} 42.3–86.4) against {ICU} admission, and 55.8 \% (95 \% {CI} 42.7–68.3) against hospital admission.
Conclusions
Our results show that, despite critical delays in vaccine delivery and limited evidence in efficacy trial estimates, {CoronaVac} contributed to preventing deaths and severe morbidity due to Covid-19 in elderly adults.},

Design Target trial emulation based on {ComPaRe} e-cohort.
Data source {ComPaRe} long covid cohort, a nationwide e-cohort (ie, a cohort where recruitment and follow-up are performed online) of patients with long covid, in France.
Methods Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) enrolled in the {ComPaRe} cohort before 1 May 2021 were included in the study if they reported a confirmed or suspected {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, symptoms persistent for {\textgreater}3 weeks after onset, and at least one symptom attributable to long covid at baseline. Patients who received a first covid-19 vaccine injection were matched with an unvaccinated control group in a 1:1 ratio according to their propensity scores. Number of long covid symptoms, rate of complete remission of long covid, and proportion of patients reporting an unacceptable symptom state at 120 days were recorded.
Results 910 patients were included in the analyses (455 in the vaccinated group and 455 in the control group). By 120 days, vaccination had reduced the number of long covid symptoms (mean 13.0 (standard deviation 9.4) in the vaccinated group v 14.8 (9.8) in the control group; mean difference −1.8, 95\% confidence interval −3.0 to −0.5) and doubled the rate of patients in remission (16.6\% v 7.5\%, hazard ratio 1.93, 95\% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.14). Vaccination reduced the effect of long covid on patients' lives (mean score on the impact tool 24.3 (standard deviation 16.7) v 27.6 (16.7); mean difference −3.3, 95\% confidence interval −5.7 to −1.0) and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom state (38.9\% v 46.4\%, risk difference −7.4\%, 95\% confidence interval −14.5\% to −0.3\%). In the vaccinated group, two (0.4\%) patients reported serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital.
Conclusion In this study, covid-19 vaccination reduced the severity of symptoms and the effect of long covid on patients' social, professional, and family lives at 120 days in those with persistent symptoms of infection.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}. The global demand for coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) vaccines currently far outweighs the available global supply and manufacturing capacity. As a result, securing doses of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries has been challenging, particularly for African countries. Clinical trial investigation for {COVID}-19 vaccines has been rare in Africa, with the only randomized clinical trials ({RCTs}) for {COVID}-19 vaccines having been conducted in South Africa. In addition to addressing the current inequities in the vaccine roll-out for low- and middle-income countries, there is a need to monitor the real-world effectiveness of {COVID}-19 vaccines in these regions. Although {RCTs} are the superior method for evaluating vaccine efficacy, the feasibility of conducting {RCTs} to monitor {COVID}-19 vaccine effectiveness during mass vaccine campaigns will likely be low. There is still a need to evaluate the effectiveness of mass {COVID}-19 vaccine distribution in a practical manner. We discuss how target trial emulation, the application of trial design principles from {RCTs} to the analysis of observational data, can be used as a practical, cost-effective way to evaluate real-world effectiveness for {COVID}-19 vaccines. There are several study design considerations that need to be made in the analyses of observational data, such as uncontrolled confounders and selection biases. Target trial emulation accounts for these considerations to improve the analyses of observational data. The framework of target trial emulation provides a practical way to monitor the effectiveness of mass vaccine campaigns for {COVID}-19 using observational data.},

	abstract = {Background Vaccines have substantially mitigated the disproportional impact of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 on the high morbidity and mortality experienced by nursing home residents. However, variation in vaccine efficacy, immune senescence and waning immunity all undermine vaccine effectiveness over time. The introduction of the bivalent vaccine in September 2022 aimed to counter this increasing susceptibility and consequences of breakthrough infection, however data on the durability and protection of the vaccine are limited. We evaluated the durability of immunity and protection after the first bivalent vaccination to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in nursing home residents.
Methods For the immunologic evaluation, community nursing home volunteers agreed to serial blood sampling before, at two weeks, three and six months after each vaccination for antibodies to spike protein and pseudovirus neutralization activity over time. Concurrent clinical outcomes were evaluated by reviewing electronic health record data from residents living in Veterans Administration managed nursing home units. Residents without recent infection but prior vaccination to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 were followed over time beginning with administration of the newly available bivalent vaccine using a target trial emulation ({TTE}) approach; {TTE} compared time to breakthrough infection, hospitalization and death between those who did and did not receive the bivalent vaccine.
Results We evaluated antibodies in 650 nursing home residents; 452 had data available following a first monovalent booster, 257 following a second monovalent booster and 321 following a bivalent vaccine. We found a rise in {BA}.5 neutralization activity from the first and second monovalent boosters through the bivalent vaccination regardless of prior {SARS}-{CoV}-2 history. Titers declined at three and six months after the bivalent vaccination but generally exceeded those at three months compared to either prior boost. {BA}.5 neutralization titers six months after the bivalent vaccination were diminished but had detectable levels in 80\% of infection-naive and 100\% of prior infected individuals. {TTE} evaluated 5903 unique subjects, of whom 2235 received the bivalent boost. {TTE} demonstrated 39\% or greater reduction in risk of infection, hospitalization or death at four months following the bivalent boost.
Conclusion Immunologic results mirrored those of the {TTE} and suggest bivalent vaccination added substantial protection for up to six months after bivalent vaccination with notable exceptions. However, the level of protection declined over this period, and by six months may open a window of added vulnerability to infection before the next updated vaccine becomes available. We strongly agree with the {CDC} recommendation that those who have not received a bivalent vaccination receive that now and these results support a second bivalent booster for those at greatest risk which includes many nursing home residents.},

	abstract = {A {SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccine booster dose has been recommended for all nursing home residents. However, data on the effectiveness of an {mRNA} vaccine booster in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death in this vulnerable population are lacking.To evaluate the association between receipt of a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {mRNA} vaccine booster and prevention of infection, hospitalization, or death among nursing home residents.This cohort study emulated sequentially nested target trials for vaccination using data from 2 large multistate {US} nursing home systems: Genesis {HealthCare}, a community nursing home operator (system 1) and Veterans Health Administration community living centers ({VHA} {CLCs}; system 2). The cohort included long-term (≥100 days) nursing home residents (10 949 residents from 202 community nursing homes and 4321 residents from 128 {VHA} {CLCs}) who completed a 2-dose series of an {mRNA} vaccine (either {BNT}162b2 [Pfizer-{BioNTech}] or {mRNA}-1273 [Moderna]) and were eligible for a booster dose between September 22 and November 30, 2021. Residents were followed up until March 8, 2022.Receipt of a third {mRNA} vaccine dose, defined as a booster dose (boosted group), or nonreceipt of a booster dose (unboosted group) on an eligible target trial date. If participants in the unboosted group received a booster dose on a later target trial date, they were included in the booster group for that target trial; thus, participants could be included in both the boosted and unboosted groups.Test-confirmed {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, hospitalization, or death was followed up to 12 weeks after booster vaccination. The primary measure of estimated vaccine effectiveness was the ratio of cumulative incidences in the boosted group vs the unboosted group at week 12, adjusted with inverse probability weights for treatment and censoring.System 1 included 202 community nursing homes; among 8332 boosted residents (5325 [63.9\%] female; 6685 [80.2\%] White) vs 10 886 unboosted residents (6865 [63.1\%] female; 8651 [79.5\%] White), the median age was 78 ({IQR}, 68-87) years vs 78 ({IQR}, 68-86) years. System 2 included 128 {VHA} {CLCs}; among 3289 boosted residents (3157 [96.0\%] male; 1950 [59.3\%] White) vs 4317 unboosted residents (4151 [96.2\%] male; 2434 [56.4\%] White), the median age was 74 ({IQR}, 70-80) vs 74 ({IQR}, 69-80) years. Booster vaccination was associated with reductions in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections of 37.7\% (95\% {CI}, 25.4\%-44.2\%) in system 1 and 57.7\% (95\% {CI}, 43.5\%-67.8\%) in system 2. For hospitalization, reductions of 74.4\% (95\% {CI}, 44.6\%-86.2\%) in system 1 and 64.1\% (95\% {CI}, 41.3\%-76.0\%) in system 2 were observed. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for death associated with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was 87.9\% (95\% {CI}, 75.9\%-93.9\%) in system 1; however, although a reduction in death was observed in system 2 (46.6\%; 95\% {CI}, −34.6\% to 94.8\%), this reduction was not statistically significant. A total of 45 {SARS}-{CoV}-2–associated deaths occurred in system 1 and 18 deaths occurred in system 2. For the combined end point of {SARS}-{CoV}-2–associated hospitalization or death, boosted residents in system 1 had an 80.3\% (95\% {CI}, 65.7\%-88.5\%) reduction, and boosted residents in system 2 had a 63.8\% (95\% {CI}, 41.4\%-76.1\%) reduction.In this study, during a period in which both the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 booster vaccination was associated with significant reductions in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections, hospitalizations, and the combined end point of hospitalization or death among residents of 2 {US} nursing home systems. These findings suggest that administration of vaccine boosters to nursing home residents may have an important role in preventing {COVID}-19–associated morbidity and mortality.},

The study emulated a target trial of {COVID}-19 vaccinated U.S. Veterans who received three doses of either {mRNA}-1273 or {BNT}162b2 vaccines. Participants were followed for up to 32 weeks between July 1, 2021 to May 30, 2022. Non-overlapping populations were average and high risk; high-risk sub-groups were age ≥65 years, high-risk co-morbid conditions, and immunocompromising conditions. Of 1,703,189 participants, 10.9 per 10,000 persons died or were hospitalized with {COVID}-19 pneumonia over 32 weeks (95\% {CI}: 10.2, 11.8). Although relative risks of death or hospitalization with {COVID}-19 pneumonia were similar across at-risk groups, absolute risk varied when comparing three doses of {BNT}162b2 with {mRNA}-1273 ({BNT}162b2 minus {mRNA}-1273) between average-risk and high-risk populations, confirmed by the presence of additive interaction. The risk difference of death or hospitalization with {COVID}-19 pneumonia for high-risk populations was 2.2 (0.9, 3.6). Effects were not modified by predominant viral variant. In this work, the risk of death or hospitalization with {COVID}-19 pneumonia over 32 weeks was lower among high-risk populations who received three doses of {mRNA}-1273 vaccine instead of {BNT}162b2 vaccine; no difference was found among the average-risk population and age {\textgreater}65 sub-group., {mRNA} boosters have been shown to be effective against severe {COVID}-19 illness. In this work, the authors show that in high-risk populations, three doses of {mRNA}-1273 vaccine instead of {BNT}162b2 vaccine conferred a small benefit against death or hospitalization with {COVID}-19 pneumonia.},

Design Nationwide cohort analyses, using target trial emulation.
Setting Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, from 1 July 2022 to 10 April 2023.
Participants People aged ≥50 years who had received at least three doses of covid-19 vaccine (that is, a primary course and a first booster).
Main outcome measures The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to compare the risk of hospital admission and death related to covid-19 in people who received a bivalent Comirnaty (Pfizer-{BioNTech}) or Spikevax (Moderna) {BA}.4-5 or {BA}.1 {mRNA} booster vaccine as a fourth dose (second booster) with three dose (first booster) vaccinated people and between four dose vaccinated people.
Results A total of 1 634 199 people receiving bivalent {BA}.4-5 fourth dose booster and 1 042 124 receiving bivalent {BA}.1 fourth dose booster across the four Nordic countries were included. Receipt of a bivalent {BA}.4-5 booster as a fourth dose was associated with a comparative vaccine effectiveness against admission to hospital with covid-19 of 67.8\% (95\% confidence interval 63.1\% to 72.5\%) and a risk difference of –91.9 (95\% confidence interval –152.4 to –31.4) per 100 000 people at three months of follow-up compared with having received three doses of vaccine (289 v 893 events). The corresponding comparative vaccine effectiveness and risk difference for bivalent {BA}.1 boosters (332 v 977 events) were 65.8\% (59.1\% to 72.4\%) and –112.9 (–179.6 to –46.2) per 100 000, respectively. Comparative vaccine effectiveness and risk difference against covid-19 related death were 69.8\% (52.8\% to 86.8\%) and –34.1 (–40.1 to –28.2) per 100 000 for bivalent {BA}.4-5 booster (93 v 325 events) and 70.0\% (50.3\% to 89.7\%) and –38.7 (–65.4 to –12.0) per 100 000 for {BA}.1 booster (86 v 286) as a fourth dose. Comparing bivalent {BA}.4-5 and {BA}.1 boosters as a fourth dose directly resulted in a three month comparative vaccine effectiveness and corresponding risk difference of –14.9\% (–62.3\% to 32.4\%) and 10.0 (–14.4 to 34.4) per 100 000 people for admission to hospital with covid-19 (802 v 932 unweighted events) and –40.7\% (–123.4\% to 42.1\%) and 8.1 (–3.3 to 19.4) per 100 000 for covid-19 related death (229 v 243 unweighted events). The comparative vaccine effectiveness did not differ across sex and age ({\textless}/≥70 years) and seemed to be sustained up to six months from the day of vaccination with modest waning.
Conclusion Vaccination with bivalent {BA}.4-5 or {BA}.1 {mRNA} booster vaccines as a fourth dose was associated with reduced rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death among adults aged ≥50 years. The protection afforded by the bivalent {BA}.4-5 and {BA}.1 boosters did not differ significantly when directly compared, and any potential difference would most likely be very small in absolute numbers.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effect of covid-19 vaccination on the severity of symptoms in patients with long covid.
Design Target trial emulation based on {ComPaRe} e-cohort.
Data source {ComPaRe} long covid cohort, a nationwide e-cohort (ie, a cohort where recruitment and follow-up are performed online) of patients with long covid, in France.
Methods Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) enrolled in the {ComPaRe} cohort before 1 May 2021 were included in the study if they reported a confirmed or suspected {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, symptoms persistent for {\textgreater}3 weeks after onset, and at least one symptom attributable to long covid at baseline. Patients who received a first covid-19 vaccine injection were matched with an unvaccinated control group in a 1:1 ratio according to their propensity scores. Number of long covid symptoms, rate of complete remission of long covid, and proportion of patients reporting an unacceptable symptom state at 120 days were recorded.
Results 910 patients were included in the analyses (455 in the vaccinated group and 455 in the control group). By 120 days, vaccination had reduced the number of long covid symptoms (mean 13.0 (standard deviation 9.4) in the vaccinated group v 14.8 (9.8) in the control group; mean difference −1.8, 95\% confidence interval −3.0 to −0.5) and doubled the rate of patients in remission (16.6\% v 7.5\%, hazard ratio 1.93, 95\% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.14). Vaccination reduced the effect of long covid on patients' lives (mean score on the impact tool 24.3 (standard deviation 16.7) v 27.6 (16.7); mean difference −3.3, 95\% confidence interval −5.7 to −1.0) and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom state (38.9\% v 46.4\%, risk difference −7.4\%, 95\% confidence interval −14.5\% to −0.3\%). In the vaccinated group, two (0.4\%) patients reported serious adverse events requiring admission to hospital.
Conclusion In this study, covid-19 vaccination reduced the severity of symptoms and the effect of long covid on patients' social, professional, and family lives at 120 days in those with persistent symptoms of infection.},

	abstract = {Vaccination with the protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, {PCV}7, has significantly reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease in populations where it is in widespread use and has had an important public health benefit. This vaccine targets only 7 of the more than 92 pneumococcal serotypes, and there have been concerns that the non-vaccine serotypes ({NVTs}) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination. Indeed, among asymptomatic carriers, the prevalence of {NVTs} has increased substantially, and as a result, there has been little or no net change in the carriage prevalence of the bacteria. In many populations, there has been an increase in pneumococcal disease caused by {NVT}, but in most cases this increase in {NVT} disease has been less than the increase in {NVT} carriage. In this article, we review the evidence for serotype replacement in carriage and disease and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings. We then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near-complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease, and address the possibility that differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes and those causing replacement could contribute to this difference. We contend that the magnitude of serotype replacement in disease can be attributed, in part, to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes, biases in the pre-vaccine carriage data (unmasking), and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement. We conclude by discussing the potential for serotype replacement in disease in the future and the need for ongoing surveillance.},

Although patients randomized to the bactrim arm experienced a significant delay in time to {POP}, the survival experience in the two arms was not significantly different (p= .32). In this paper, we present evidence that bactrim therapy improves survival but that the standard intent-to-treat comparison failed to detect this survival advantage because a large fraction of the subjects either crossed over to the other therapy or stopped therapy altogether. We obtain our evidence of a beneficial bactrim effect on survival by artificially regarding the subjects as dependently censored at the first time the subject either stops or switches therapy; we then analyze the data with the inverse probability of censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox partial likelihood estimators of Robins (1993, Proceedings of the Biopharmaceutical Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 24–33) that adjust for dependent censoring by utilizing data collected on time-dependent prognostic factors.},

	abstract = {Background. Rotavirus is the world's leading cause of childhood diarrheal death. Despite successes, oral rotavirus vaccines are less effective in developing countries. In an urban slum of Dhaka, we performed active diarrhea surveillance to evaluate monovalent G1P[8] rotavirus vaccine ({RV}1) efficacy and understand variables contributing to risk of rotavirus diarrhea ({RVD}).Methods. We performed a randomized controlled trial of monovalent oral rotavirus vaccine ({RV}1). Seven hundred healthy infants received {RV}1 or no {RV}1 (1:1) using delayed dosing (10 and 17 weeks) and were followed for 1 year. Intensive diarrhea surveillance was performed. The primary outcome was ≥1 episode of {RVD}. Nutritional, socioeconomic, and immunologic factors were assessed by logistic regression best-subsets analysis for association with risk of {RVD} and interactions with vaccine arm.Results. Incidence of all {RVD} was 38.3 cases per 100 person-years. Per-protocol {RV}1 efficacy was 73.5\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 45.8\%–87.0\%) against severe {RVD} and 51\% (95\% {CI}, 33.8\%–63.7\%) against all {RVD}. Serum zinc level (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.77; P = .002) and lack of rotavirus immunoglobulin A ({IgA}) seroconversion ({OR}, 1.95; P = .018) were associated with risk of {RVD}, independent of vaccination status. Water treatment and exclusive breastfeeding were of borderline significance. Factors not associated with {RVD} included height for age at 10 weeks, vitamin D, retinol binding protein, maternal education, household income, and sex.Conclusions. In an urban slum with high incidence of {RVD}, the efficacy of {RV}1 against severe {RVD} was higher than anticipated in the setting of delayed dosing. Lower serum zinc level and lack of {IgA} seroconversion were associated with increased risk of {RVD} independent of vaccination.Clinical Trials Registration. {NCT}01375647.},

	abstract = {Background. The recommended schedule for receipt of 2-dose human rotavirus vaccine ({HRV}) coincides with receipt of the first and second doses of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine (ie, 6 and 10 weeks of age, respectively). Alternative schedules and additional doses of {HRV} have been proposed and may improve vaccine performance in low-income countries., Methods. In this randomized trial in rural Ghana, {HRV} was administered at ages 6 and 10 weeks (group 1), 10 and 14 weeks (group 2), or 6, 10, and 14 weeks (group 3). We compared serum antirotavirus immunoglobulin A ({IgA}) seroconversion (≥20 U/{mL}) and geometric mean concentrations ({GMCs}) between group 1 and groups 2 and 3., Results. Ninety-three percent of participants (424 of 456) completed the study per protocol. In groups 1, 2, and 3, the {IgA} seroconversion frequencies among participants with {IgA} levels of {\textless}20 U/{mL} at baseline were 28.9\%, 37.4\%, and 43.4\%, respectively (group 1 vs group 3, P = .014; group 1 vs group 2, P = .163).

	abstract = {Background
Human rotavirus vaccine ({HRV}; i.e., Rotarix) reduced the incidence of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis ({RVGE}) by 77\% (95\% Confidence interval: 56–88\%) during the first year of life in South Africa. Persistence of {HRV}-derived protection against {RVGE} during subsequent rotavirus seasons, although evident in industrialized settings, remains to be established in African settings. This study reports on the efficacy of {HRV} against severe {RVGE} over two consecutive rotavirus seasons in South African children.
Methods
A prospective, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-centered trial in South Africa and Malawi randomly assigned infants in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either two (10 and 14weeks; {HRV}\_2D) or three (6, 10 and 14weeks; {HRV}\_3D) doses of {HRV} or placebo. The primary analysis involved pooling of {HRV}\_2D and {HRV}\_3D arms. Episodes of gastroenteritis caused by wild-type rotavirus were identified through active follow-up surveillance and graded by the Vesikari scale.
Results
1339 infants (447 in the {HRV}\_2D group, 447 in the {HRV}\_3D group and 445 in the placebo group) were enrolled in Year 2 of the study, including 1035 (77.3\%) who were followed up over two consecutive rotavirus seasons (i.e., Cohort 2 subjects). Rotarix was associated with ongoing protection against severe {RVGE}, preventing 2.5 episodes per 100 vaccinated children over two consecutive rotavirus seasons; vaccine efficacy: 59\% (95\% Confidence interval: 1–83\%). An exploratory analysis indicated better immunogenicity (among Cohort 1 subjects) and a higher point-efficacy estimate over two seasons in the {HRV}\_3D compared to {HRV}\_2D arms of the study in Cohort 2 subjects.
Conclusion
Rotarix is associated with significant reductions in severe gastroenteritis episodes through 2years of life among South African children. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosing schedule of Rotarix in providing long-term protection against rotavirus illness in African children.},

	abstract = {Because the real-world impact of new vaccines cannot be known before they are implemented in national programs, post-implementation studies at the population level are critical. Studies based on analysis of hospitalization rates of vaccine-preventable outcomes are typically used for this purpose. However, estimates of vaccine impact based on hospitalization data are particularly prone to confounding, as hospitalization rates are tightly linked to changes in the quality, access and use of the healthcare system, which often occur simultaneously with introduction of new vaccines. Here we illustrate how changes in healthcare delivery coincident with vaccine introduction can influence estimates of vaccine impact, using as an example reductions in infant pneumonia hospitalizations after introduction of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}10) in Brazil. To this end, we explore the effect of changes in several metrics of quality and access to public healthcare on trends in hospitalization rates before (2008–09) and after (2011−12) {PCV}10 introduction in 2010. Changes in infant pneumonia hospitalization rates following vaccine introduction were significantly associated with concomitant changes in hospital capacity and the fraction of the population using public hospitals. Importantly, reduction of pneumonia hospitalization rates after {PCV}10 were also associated with the expansion of outpatient services in several Brazilian states, falling more sharply where primary care coverage and the number of health units offering basic and emergency care increased more. We show that adjustments for unrelated (non-vaccine) trends commonly employed by impact studies, such as use of single control outcomes, are not always sufficient for accurate impact assessment. We discuss several ways to identify and overcome such biases, including sensitivity analyses using different denominators to calculate hospitalizations rates and methods that track changes in the outpatient setting. Employing these practices can improve the accuracy of vaccine impact estimates, particularly in evolving healthcare settings typical of low- and middle-income countries.},

The problem of incorporating resource constraints into optimal treatment strategies has been solved for point exposures , that is, treatment strategies entailing a decision at just one time point. However, attempts to directly generalize the point exposure solution to dynamic time-varying treatment strategies run into complications. We sidestep these complications by targeting the optimal strategy within a clinically defined subclass. Our approach is to employ dynamic marginal structural models to estimate (counterfactual) resource usage under the class of candidate treatment strategies and solve a constrained optimization problem to choose the optimal strategy for which expected resource usage is within acceptable limits. We apply this method to determine the optimal dynamic monitoring strategy for people living with {HIV} when resource limits on monitoring exist using observational data from the {HIV}-{CAUSAL} Collaboration.},

Developing a causal graph is an important step in etiologic research planning and can be used to highlight data flaws and irreparable bias and confounding. As a case study, we consider recent findings that suggest human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine is less effective against {HPV}-associated disease among girls living with {HIV} compared to girls without {HIV}.

Objectives:
To understand the relationship between {HIV} status and {HPV} vaccine effectiveness, it is important to outline the key assumptions of the causal mechanisms before designing a study to investigate the effect of the {HPV} vaccine in girls living with {HIV} infection.

Methods:
We present a causal graph to describe our assumptions and proposed approach to explore this relationship. We hope to obtain feedback on our assumptions prior to data analysis and exemplify the process for designing causal graphs to inform an etiologic study.

Conclusion:
The approach we lay out in this paper may be useful for other researchers who have an interest in using causal graphs to describe and assess assumptions in their own research prior to undergoing data collection and/or analysis.},

	volume = {34},
	doi = {10.1097/EDE.0000000000001601},
	abstract = {Background:
Randomized trials in pregnancy are extremely challenging, and observational studies are often the only option to evaluate medication safety during pregnancy. However, such studies are often susceptible to immortal time bias if treatment initiation occurs after
time zero of follow-up. We describe how emulating a sequence of target trials avoids immortal time bias and apply the approach to estimate the safety of antibiotic initiation between 24 and 37 weeks gestation on preterm delivery. 
Methods:
The Tsepamo Study captured birth
outcomes at hospitals throughout Botswana from 2014 to 2021. We emulated 13 sequential target trials of antibiotic initiation versus no initiation among individuals presenting to care {\textless}24 weeks, one for each week from 24 to 37 weeks. For each trial, eligible individuals had not previously
initiated antibiotics. We also conducted an analysis susceptible to immortal time bias by defining time zero as 24 weeks and exposure as antibiotic initiation between 24 and 37 weeks. We calculated adjusted risk ratios ({RR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) for preterm delivery. 
Results:
Of 111,403 eligible individuals, 17,009 (15.3\%) initiated antibiotics between 24 and 37 weeks. In the sequence of target trials, {RRs} (95\% {CIs}) ranged from 1.04 (0.90, 1.19) to 1.24 (1.11, 1.39) (pooled {RR}: 1.11 [1.06, 1.15]). In the analysis susceptible to immortal time bias, the {RR} was
0.90 (0.86, 0.94). 
Conclusions:
Defining exposure as antibiotic initiation at any time during follow-up after time zero resulted in substantial immortal time bias, making antibiotics appear protective against preterm delivery. Conducting a sequence of target trials can
avoid immortal time bias in pregnancy studies.},

	abstract = {A valuable metric in understanding local infectious disease dynamics is the local time-varying reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary local cases caused by each infected individual. Accurate estimation of this quantity requires distinguishing cases arising from local transmission from those imported from elsewhere. Realistically, we can expect identification of cases as local or imported to be imperfect. We study the propagation of such errors in estimation of the local time-varying reproduction number. In addition, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimation of the true local time-varying reproduction number when identification errors exist. And we illustrate the practical performance of our estimator through simulation studies and with outbreaks of {COVID}-19 in Hong Kong and Victoria, Australia.

	abstract = {The reproductive number is an important metric that has been widely used to quantify the infectiousness of communicable diseases. The time-varying instantaneous reproductive number is useful for monitoring the real-time dynamics of a disease to inform policy making for disease control. Local estimation of this metric, for instance at a county or city level, allows for more targeted interventions to curb transmission. However, simultaneous estimation of local reproductive numbers must account for potential sources of heterogeneity in these time-varying quantities—a key element of which is human mobility. We develop a statistical method that incorporates human mobility between multiple regions for estimating region-specific instantaneous reproductive numbers. The model also can account for exogenous cases imported from outside of the regions of interest. We propose two approaches to estimate the reproductive numbers, with mobility data used to adjust incidence in the first approach and to inform a formal priori distribution in the second (Bayesian) approach. Through a simulation study, we show that region-specific reproductive numbers can be well estimated if human mobility is reasonably well approximated by available data. We use this approach to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers of {COVID}-19 for 14 counties in Massachusetts using {CDC} case report data and the human mobility data collected by {SafeGraph}. We found that, accounting for mobility, our method produces estimates of reproductive numbers that are distinct across counties. In contrast, independent estimation of county-level reproductive numbers tends to produce similar values, as trends in county case-counts for the state are fairly concordant. These approaches can also be used to estimate any heterogeneity in transmission, for instance, age-dependent instantaneous reproductive number estimates. As people are more mobile and interact frequently in ways that permit transmission, it is important to account for this in the estimation of the reproductive number.},

However, aggregated case report data suffers from reporting delays and can lead to misleading inferences. Different from aggregated case report data, line list data is a table contains individual features such as dates of symptom onset and reporting for each reported case and a good source for modeling delays. Current methods for modeling reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which typically has missing symptom onset dates that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. Specifically, this Bayesian approach can accurately estimate the epidemic curve and instantaneous reproduction numbers, even with most symptom onset dates missing. The Bayesian approach is also robust to deviations from model assumptions, such as changes in the reporting delay distribution or incorrect specification of the maximum reporting delay. We apply the Bayesian approach to {COVID}-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproduction number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.},

Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates.In simulations, we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95\%). Additionally, only a subset of the cases, 10–50\% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany.Our method is a novel way to infer transmission dynamics in any dataset when only a subset of cases has rich contact investigation and/or genetic data.},

	abstract = {Background
Pneumococcal diseases are major causes of morbidity among adults, especially those over 50years of age. While pneumococcal conjugated vaccines ({PCV}’s) impact on pneumococcal disease rates among children is well established, the extent of its impact on adult pneumococcal related illness remains unclear. The aim of this systematic literature review was to describe the impact of {PCV} introduction to childhood national immunization programs worldwide on {PCV}-naive adult population.
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed using the {PubMed} database. The search was limited to articles written in English and published between January 2000 and February 2016. Studies evaluating pneumococcal disease rates in individuals over 5years of age were included. Independent extraction of articles was performed by the two authors. Search terms included: Pneumococcal conjugated vaccine, herd, indirect, adults, and pneumonia.
Results
Forty-nine articles meeting the selection criteria were identified, 39 regarding invasive pneumococcal disease ({IPD}, one on meningitis only), 8 regarding pneumonia, and 2 on both {IPD} and pneumonia. The majority of reports were from the {US}, {UK} and Canada. Considerable variability in the data sources, quality and completeness was observed. While most studies reported either statistically significant reduction or insignificant changes in {IPD} and pneumonia disease rates in adults following {PCV} nationwide implementation, few studies reported statistically significant increase in pneumococcal disease rates, these were mainly from countries with low {PCV} coverage rates and/or inadequate surveillance.
Conclusion
Invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia rates among the adult population decreased in most countries following {PCV} introduction into the {NIP}. This indirect effect on older population seems to be dependent on {PCV} coverage rates and time from {PCV} nationwide implementation. Adults {\textgreater}65years old seem to benefit the most from {PCV} introduction.},

Results After five {PCV}10/13 years, the incidence of {IPD} caused by all types, {PCV}7 and additional {PCV}13 serotypes declined 9\% (95\% {CI} −4\% to 19\%), 77\% (95\% {CI} 67\% to 84\%) and 38\% (95\% {CI} 19\% to 53\%), respectively, while the incidence of non-{PCV}13 serotypes increased 63\% (95\% {CI} 39\% to 91\%). The incidence of serotypes included in {PCV}13 and not in {PCV}10 decreased 37\% (95\% {CI} 22\% to 50\%) in six {PCV}13 sites and increased by 50\% (95\% {CI} −8\% to 146\%) in the four sites using {PCV}10 (alone or with {PCV}13). In 2015, {PCV}13 serotypes represented 20–29\% and 32–53\% of {IPD} cases in {PCV}13 and {PCV}10 sites, respectively.
Conclusion Overall {IPD} incidence in older adults decreased moderately after five childhood {PCV}10/13 years in 13 European sites. Large declines in {PCV}10/13 serotype {IPD}, due to the indirect effect of childhood vaccination, were countered by increases in non-{PCV}13 {IPD}, but these declines varied according to the childhood vaccine used. Decision-making on pneumococcal vaccination for older adults must consider the indirect effects of childhood {PCV} programmes. Sustained monitoring of {IPD} epidemiology is imperative.},

	abstract = {Background: 
          To aid decision making for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ({PCV}) use in infant national immunization programs, we summarized the indirect effects of {PCV} on clinical outcomes among nontargeted age groups.
          Methods: 
          We systematically reviewed the English literature on infant {PCV} dosing schedules published from 1994 to 2010 (with ad hoc addition of 2011 articles) for outcomes on children {\textgreater}5 years of age and adults including vaccine-type nasopharyngeal carriage ({VT}-{NP}), vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease ({VT}-{IPD}) and syndromic pneumonia.
          Results: 
          Of 12,980 citations reviewed, we identified 21 {VT}-{IPD}, 6 {VT}-{NP} and 9 pneumonia studies. Of these 36, 21 (58\%) included 3 primary doses plus {PCV} or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ({PPV}23) booster schedule (3+1 or 3+{PPV}23), 5 (14\%) 3+0, 9 (25\%) 2+1 and 1 (3\%) 2+0. Most (95\%) were {PCV}7 studies. Among observational {VT}-{IPD} studies, all schedules (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1) demonstrated reductions in incidence among young adult groups. Among syndromic pneumonia observational studies (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1), only 3+1 schedules showed significant indirect impact. Of 2 {VT}-{NP} controlled trials (3+0 and 3+1) and 3 {VT}-{NP} observational studies (2+1, 3+1 and 3+{PPV}23), 3+1 and 3+{PPV}23 schedules showed significant indirect effect. The 1 study to directly compare between schedules was a {VT}-{NP} study (2+0 vs. 2+1), which found no indirect effect on older siblings and parents of vaccinated children with either schedule.
          Conclusions: 
          Indirect benefit of a 3+1 infant {PCV} dosing schedule has been demonstrated for {VT}-{IPD}, {VT}-{NP} and syndromic pneumonia; 2+1 and 3+0 schedules have demonstrated indirect effect only for {VT}-{IPD}. The choice of optimal infant {PCV} schedule is limited by data paucity on indirect effects, especially a lack of head-to-head studies and studies of {PCV}10 and {PCV}13.},

	abstract = {When is it better to use agent-based ({AB}) models, and when should differential equation ({DE}) models be used? Whereas {DE} models assume homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments, {AB} models can capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of interactions among them. {AB} models relax aggregation assumptions, but entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity analysis and model scope. Because resources are limited, the costs and benefits of such disaggregation should guide the choice of models for policy analysis. Using contagious disease as an example, we contrast the dynamics of a stochastic {AB} model with those of the analogous deterministic compartment {DE} model. We examine the impact of individual heterogeneity and different network topologies, including fully connected, random, Watts-Strogatz small world, scale-free, and lattice networks. Obviously, deterministic models yield a single trajectory for each parameter set, while stochastic models yield a distribution of outcomes. More interestingly, the {DE} and mean {AB} dynamics differ for several metrics relevant to public health, including diffusion speed, peak load on health services infrastructure, and total disease burden. The response of the models to policies can also differ even when their base case behavior is similar. In some conditions, however, these differences in means are small compared to variability caused by stochastic events, parameter uncertainty, and model boundary. We discuss implications for the choice among model types, focusing on policy design. The results apply beyond epidemiology: from innovation adoption to financial panics, many important social phenomena involve analogous processes of diffusion and social contagion.},

	abstract = {Objective To describe the participation of minority women in clinical trials using immunologic agents for breast and gynecologic cancers.
Methods A retrospective review of completed clinical trials involving immunotherapy for breast and gynecologic cancers was performed. Completed trials were examined for data on race, tumor type, and start year. Minority enrollment was stratified by tumor site. Based on Center for Disease Control and Prevention age-adjusted incidence for race, expected and observed ratios of racial participation were calculated and compared using Χ2 testing, p≤0.05.
Results A total of 53 completed immunotherapy clinical trials involving 8820 patients were reviewed. Breast cancer trials were most common (n=24) and involved the most patients (n=6248, 71\%). Racial breakdown was provided in 41 studies (77\%) for a total of 7201 patients. Race reporting was lowest in uterine (n=4, 67\%) and cervical cancer trials (n=6, 67\%), and highest in ovarian cancer trials (n=12, 86\%). White patients comprised 70\% (n=5022) of all the patients included. Only 5\% of patients involved were black (n=339), and 83\% of these patients (n=282) were enrolled in breast cancer trials. Observed enrollment of black women was 32-fold lower for ovarian, 19-fold lower for cervical, 15-fold lower for uterine, and 11-fold lower for breast cancer than expected. While all trials reported race between 2013 and 2015, no consistent trend was seen towards increasing race reporting or in enrollment of black patients over time.
Conclusion Racial disparities exist in clinical trials evaluating immunologic agents for breast and gynecologic cancers. Recruitment of black women is particularly low. In order to address inequity in outcomes for these cancers, it is crucial that significant attention be directed towards minority representation in immuno-oncologic clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Objectives
It is important to develop effective therapies in minorities to ensure equity in cancer care. Underrepresentation of minorities in early phase trials may cause therapies that are effective only in majority populations. We evaluated minority participation in gynecologic oncology phase 1 clinical trials.
Methods
In peer-reviewed published articles of gynecologic oncology phase 1 clinical trials from years 1985 to 2018, we manually abstracted racial distribution of enrolled participants, cancer type, and year published. We calculated expected and observed ratios of racial participation on the basis of age-adjusted cancer incidence for race from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Results
We identified 357 articles of phase 1 trials (total, 9492 participants), including 213 articles on ovarian cancer (60\%). Racial distribution of participants was available in 84 articles (23\%) that included 2483 participants (26\%): 1950 white (79\%), 140 black (5\%), and 393 other participants (16\%). Other nonwhite races exceeded black enrollment in 46 of 84 trials (55\%) that listed race. Enrollment of black participants was less than expected from disease incidence for ovarian (incidence-to-enrollment ratio, 18.5; P {\textless} .001), endometrial (3.6; P {\textless} .001), and cervical cancer (6.8; P {\textless} .001). No phase 1 study met expected enrollment for black participants. Frequency of black participants decreased 1.8-fold from 1995 to 1999 (8 of 70 participants [11\%]) to 2015–2018 (55 of 892 participants [6\%]; P {\textless} .025).
Conclusions
Major racial underrepresentation exists in gynecologic oncology phase 1 clinical trials. Enrollment of more black participants is needed to achieve racial equity.},

They concluded that {EOS} was safe and effective on the basis of similar 90-day all-cause mortality in the cohort treated with {EOS} and the cohort that received prolonged intravenous antibiotic treatment. This conclusion is consistent with that reported in a recent randomized clinical trial ({RCT}), which showed that when using a composite end point of treatment failure (death, need for additional antimicrobial therapy, microbiological relapse, or infection-related readmission at 90 days), {EOS} was not inferior to continuing oral therapy. Nonetheless, further data are required to determine the ideal timing of {EOS} and to identify the most effective oral agents for this strategy. This includes investigating whether β-lactam antibiotics are adequate as oral step-down agents in treating these infections, as opposed to fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. As Tingsgård et al noted, another large multinational {RCT} is underway addressing some of these questions, and a {US}-based {RCT} on {EOS} is expected to commence recruitment in 2024.},

We might refer to the first of these mechanisms as a contagion effect and the second as an infectiousness effect. In the simple setting of a randomized vaccine trial with households of size two, we use counterfactual theory under interference to provide formal definitions of a contagion effect and an unconditional infectiousness effect. Using ideas analogous to mediation analysis, we show that the indirect effect (the effect of one person's vaccine on another's outcome) can be decomposed into a contagion effect and an unconditional infectiousness effect on the risk difference, risk ratio, odds ratio, and vaccine efficacy scales. We provide identification assumptions for such contagion and unconditional infectiousness effects and describe a simple statistical technique to estimate these effects when they are identified. We also give a sensitivity analysis technique to assess how inferences would change under violations of the identification assumptions. The concepts and results of this paper are illustrated with hypothetical vaccine trial data.},

Establishing indirect effects of vaccination in unvaccinated subpopulations could have important implications for global vaccine policies. In the minicommunity design, the household or other small transmission unit serves as the cluster in which to estimate indirect effects of vaccination, similar to studies in larger communities to estimate indirect, total, and overall effects. Examples from the literature include studies in small transmission units to estimate indirect effects of pertussis, pneumococcal, influenza, and cholera vaccines. We characterize the minicommunity design by several methodologic considerations, including the assignment mechanism, ascertainment, the role of transmission outside the transmission unit, and the relation of the size of the transmission unit to number of people vaccinated. The minicommunity study for indirect effects is contrasted with studies to estimate vaccine effects on infectiousness and protective effects under conditions of household exposure within small transmission units. The minicommunity design can be easily implemented in individually randomized studies by enrolling and following-up members of households of the randomized individuals. The methodology for the minicommunity design for estimating indirect effects of vaccination deserves much future research.},

However, in light of emerging methodologies in data science, many experts question the role of {RCTs}. Within this context, experts in the {USA} and Canada came together to debate whether the primacy of {RCTs} as the gold standard for medical evidence, still holds in light of recent methodological advances in data science and in the era of big data. The purpose of this manuscript, aims to raise awareness of the pros and cons of {RCTs} and observational studies in order to help guide clinicians, researchers, students, and decision-makers in making informed decisions on the quality of medical evidence to support their work. In particular, new and underappreciated advantages and disadvantages of both designs are contrasted. Innovations taking place in both of these research methodologies, which can blur the lines between the two, are also discussed. Finally, practical guidance for clinicians and future directions in assessing the quality of evidence is offered.},

We compared three protocols defined by interdose interval: recommended by the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) (17-25 days for Pfizer-{BioNTech}; 24-32 days for Moderna), late-but-allowable (26-42 days for Pfizer-{BioNTech}; 33-49 days for Moderna), and late ( ≥ 43 days for Pfizer-{BioNTech}; ≥50 days for Moderna). In the short-term, the risk of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection was lowest under the {FDA}-recommended protocol. Longer-term, the late-but-allowable protocol resulted in the lowest risk (risk ratio on Day 120 after the first dose administration compared to the {FDA}-recommended protocol: 0.83 [95\% confidence interval: 0.82-0.84]). Here, we showed that delaying the second dose by 1-2 weeks may provide stronger long-term protection.},

Data on the safety and efficacy of {IPT} in pregnant women living with {HIV} ({PWLHIV}) are mixed. We used an individual-level, population-wide health database to examine associations between antenatal {IPT} exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal {TB}, all-cause mortality, and liver injury during pregnancy through 12 months postpartum.We used linked routine electronic health data generated in the public sector of the Western Cape, South Africa, to define a cohort of {PWLHIV} on antiretroviral therapy. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed using logistic regression; for maternal outcomes we applied a proportional hazards model with time-updated {IPT} exposure.Of 43 971 {PWLHIV}, 16.6\% received {IPT}. Women who received {IPT} were less likely to experience poor pregnancy outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [{aOR}], 0.83 [95\% confidence interval \{{CI}\}, .78–.87]); this association strengthened with {IPT} started after the first trimester compared with none ({aOR}, 0.71 [95\% {CI}, .65–.79]) or with first-trimester exposure ({aOR}, 0.64 [95\% {CI}, .55–.75]). {IPT} reduced the risk of {TB} by approximately 30\% ({aHR}, 0.71 [95\% {CI}, .63–.81]; absolute risk difference, 1518/100 000 women). The effect was modified by {CD}4 cell count with protection conferred if {CD}4 count was ≤350 cells/μL ({aHR}, 0.51 [95\% {CI}, .41–.63]) vs 0.93 [95\% {CI}, .76–1.13] for {CD}4 count \&gt;350 cells/µL).This analysis of programmatic data is reassuring regarding the safety of antenatal {IPT}, with the greatest benefits against {TB} disease observed in women with {CD}4 count ≤350 cells/μL.},

	abstract = {Objective Systematic analysis of observational medical databases for active safety surveillance is hindered by the variation in data models and coding systems. Data analysts often find robust clinical data models difficult to understand and ill suited to support their analytic approaches. Further, some models do not facilitate the computations required for systematic analysis across many interventions and outcomes for large datasets. Translating the data from these idiosyncratic data models to a common data model ({CDM}) could facilitate both the analysts' understanding and the suitability for large-scale systematic analysis. In addition to facilitating analysis, a suitable {CDM} has to faithfully represent the source observational database. Before beginning to use the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ({OMOP}) {CDM} and a related dictionary of standardized terminologies for a study of large-scale systematic active safety surveillance, the authors validated the model's suitability for this use by example.Validation by example To validate the {OMOP} {CDM}, the model was instantiated into a relational database, data from 10 different observational healthcare databases were loaded into separate instances, a comprehensive array of analytic methods that operate on the data model was created, and these methods were executed against the databases to measure performance.Conclusion There was acceptable representation of the data from 10 observational databases in the {OMOP} {CDM} using the standardized terminologies selected, and a range of analytic methods was developed and executed with sufficient performance to be useful for active safety surveillance.},

Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics ({OHDSI}) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10\% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25\% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results.

We aim to investigate the implementation of Target Trial Emulation ({TTE}) for causal inference, involving research topics, frequently used strategies, and issues indicating the need for future improvements.
Study Design and Setting
We performed a scoping review by following the Joanna Briggs Institute ({JBI}) guidance and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews ({PRISMA}-{ScR}) checklist. A health research–focused librarian searched multiple medical databases, and two independent reviewers completed screening and extraction within covidence review management software.
Results
Our search resulted in 1,240 papers, of which 96 papers were eligible for data extraction. Results show a significant increase in the use of {TTE} in 2018 and 2021. The study topics varied and focused primarily on cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. However, not all papers specified well all three critical components for generating robust causal evidence: time-zero, random assignment simulation, and comparison strategy. Some common issues were observed from retrieved papers, and key limitations include residual confounding, limited generalizability, and a lack of reporting guidance that need to be improved.
Conclusion
Uneven adherence to the {TTE} framework exists, and future improvements are needed to progress applications using causal inference with observational data.},

We estimated the risk of primary {PcP} in patients on {ART}, using the hazard ratio ({HR}) to compare the stopping strategies by fitting a pooled logistic model, including inverse probability weights to adjust for the selection bias introduced by the artificial censoring.A total of 4813 patients (10 324 person-years) complied with eligibility conditions for the emulated trial. With primary {PcP} diagnosis as an endpoint, the adjusted {HR} ({aHR}) indicated a slightly lower, but not statistically significant, different risk for the strategy based on viral suppression alone compared with the existing guidelines ({aHR}, .8; 95\% confidence interval, .6–1.1; P = .2).This study suggests that primary {PcP} prophylaxis might be safely withheld in confirmed virologically suppressed patients on {ART}, regardless of their {CD}4 count.},

	doi = {10.1097/EDE.0000000000000041},
	abstract = {Background: 
          Cohort studies have demonstrated greater risk of myocardial infarction ({MI}) associated with specific antiretroviral use, while meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) have not. These differences may be due to inherent biases in the observational study design or to the limited duration of randomized trials. We conducted a new-user, active-comparator cohort study emulating an {RCT} comparing the initiation of several antiretrovirals as part of combination antiretroviral therapy ({cART}) and {MI}.
          Methods: 
          We included North Carolina ({NC}) Medicaid beneficiaries infected with human immunodeficiency virus between 2002 and 2008 who were previously untreated with {cART}. We compared hazard ratios ({HRs}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) of {MI} between abacavir and tenofovir recipients, and lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir recipients and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ({NNRTI}) recipients. We adjusted for confounding through inverse probability weighting methods.
          Results: 
          There were 3481 {NC} Medicaid new {cART} recipients who contributed 6399 person-years and experienced 38 {MI} events. Receiving abacavir compared with tenofovir as part of {cART} was associated with an increased rate of {MI} (unadjusted {HR} = 2.70 [95\% {CI} = 1.24–5.91]; adjusted {HR} = 2.05 [0.72–5.86]). Point estimates also suggest a relationship between receipt of atazanavir or lopinavir-ritonavir compared with an {NNRTI} and {MI}, although estimates were imprecise.
          Conclusions: 
          We found an increased rate of {MI} among patients initiating abacavir compared with tenofovir, although the association was decreased after confounding adjustment. Without a very large prospective comparative clinical trial, a much larger observational study of patients initiating {cART} would be needed to better define this apparent association.},

	abstract = {Concomitant with expanded legalization, cannabis is increasingly used to treat chronic pain among persons with {HIV} ({PWH}), despite equivocal benefit in research limited by small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. To address these limitations, among a sample of {PWH} with pain interference enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, we performed a target trial emulation study to compare the impact of four cannabis use strategies on pain interference. Among those receiving long-term opioid therapy ({LTOT}), we also explored impact of these strategies on ≥ 25\% {LTOT} dose reduction. Among the analytic sample (N = 1284), the majority were men with a mean age of 50. Approximately 31\% used cannabis and 12\% received {LTOT} at baseline. Adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, cannabis use in any of 4 longitudinal patterns was not associated with resolved pain interference over 12- to 24-month follow-up. Among 153 participants receiving {LTOT} at baseline, cannabis use at both baseline and follow-up was negatively associated with {LTOT} dose reduction compared to no use at both baseline and follow-up. These findings support other observational studies finding no association between cannabis use and improved chronic pain or {LTOT} reduction among {PWH}.},
